1,How will the assessment of clinical trial applications be carried out under the new regulation?,"The assessment of clinical trial applications will be carried out by the concerned Member States in a coordinated manner, using a single assessment model that includes both national and international coordination and evaluation of safety reports and results of inspections.",,"['I \n(Legislativ e acts) \nREGUL ATIONS \nREGUL ATION (EU) No 536/2014 OF THE EUR OPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL \nof 16 Apr il 2014 \non clinical trials on medicinal products for human use, and repealing Directiv e 2001/20/EC \n(Text with EEA relevance) \nTHE EUR OPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUR OPEAN UNION, \nHaving regar d to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 114 and 168(4)(c) \nthereof, \nHaving regar d to the proposal from the European Commission, \nAfter transmission of the draf t legislative act to the national parliaments, \nHaving regar d to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committ ee (1), \nAfter consulting the Committ ee of the Regions, \nActing in accordance with the ordinar y legislative procedure (2), \nWhereas: \n(1)  In a clinical trial the rights, safety , dignity and well-being of subjects should be protect ed and the data generat ed \nshould be reliable and robust. The inter ests of the subjects should alwa ys take priority over all other interests. \n(2)  In order to allow for independent control as to whether these principles are adhered to, a clinical trial should be \nsubject to prior author isation. \n(3)  The existing definition of a clinical trial as contained in Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and of \nthe Council (3) should be clarified. For that purpose, the concept of clinical trial should be more precisely defined \nby introducing the broader concept of ‘clinical study’ of which the clinical trial is a catego ry. That catego ry \nshould be defined on the basis of specific criteria. This approach takes due account of intern ational guidelines, \nand is in line with the Union law governing medicinal products, whic h builds on the dichotom y of ‘clinical trial’ \nand ‘non-int erventional study’ . \n(4)  Directive 2001/20/EC aims to simplify and harmonise the administrative provisions governing clinical trials in \nthe Union. However , exper ience shows that a harmonised approach to the regulation of clinical trials has only \nbeen partly achieved. This make s it in particular difficult to perform a given clinical trial in several Member 27.5.2014 L 158/1 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     \n(1)OJ C 44, 15.2.2013, p. 99. \n(2)Position of the European Parliament of 3 Apr il 2014 (not yet published in the Official Jour nal) and decision of the Council of 14 Apr il \n2014. \n(3)Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 Apr il 2001 on the appro ximation of the laws, regulations and \nadministrative provisions of the Member States relating to the implementation of good clinical practice in the conduct of clinical trials on \nmedicinal products for human use (OJ L 121, 1.5.2001, p. 34). States. Scientific development, however , sugges ts that future clinical trials will target more specifi c patient popula \xad\ntions, such as subgroups identif ied through genomic information. In order to include a suffi cient number of \npatients for such clinical trials it may be necessar y to involve many , or all, Member State s. The new procedures \nfor the author isation of clinical trials should stimulate the inclusion of as man y Member States as possible. There \xad\nfore, in order to simplify the procedures for the submission of an application dossier for the author isation of a \nclinical trial, the multiple submission of largely identical information should be avoided and replaced by the \nsubmission of one application dossier to all the Member States concer ned through a sing le submission portal. \nGiven that clinical trials carried out in a sing le Member State are equally impor tant to European clinical research, \nthe application dossier for such clinical trials should also be submitte d through that sing le portal. \n(5)  As regar ds Directive 2001/20/EC, exper ience also indicates that the legal form of a Regulation would present \nadvantag es for sponsors and investigat ors, for example in the context of clinical trials taking place in more than \none Member State, since they will be able to rely on its provisions directly , but also in the cont ext of safety \nrepor ting and labelling of investig ational medicinal products. Divergences of approach among diffe rent Member \nStates will be theref ore kept to a minimum. \n(6) The Member State s concer ned should cooperate in assessing a request for author isation of a clinical trial. This co\xad\noperation should not include aspects of an intrinsically national nature, such as informed consent. \n(7)  In order to avoid administrative dela ys for starting a clinical trial, the procedure to be used should be flexible and \nefficient, without compromising patient safety or public health. \n(8)  The timelines for assessing an application dossier for clinical trials should be sufficient to assess the file while, at \nthe same time, ensur ing quic k access to new , inno vative treatments and ensur ing that the Union remains an \nattractive place for conducting clinical trials. Agai nst this back ground, Directive 2001/20/EC introduced the \nconcep t of tacit author isation. This concep t should be maintained in order to ensure that timelines are adhered \nto. In the event of a public health crisis, Member States should have the possibility to assess and author ise a clin\xad\nical trial application swif tly. No minimal timelines for appro val should theref ore be established. \n(9)  Clinical trials for the development of orphan medicinal products as defined in Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 of \nthe European Parliament and of the Council (1) and of medicinal products addressed to subjects affect ed by \nsevere, debilitating and often life-thr eatening diseases affect ing no more than one person in 50 000 in the Union \n(ultra-rare diseases) should be foste red. \n(10)  Member States should efficiently assess all clinical trials applications within the given timelines. A rapid yet in- \ndepth assessment is of particular impor tance for clinical trials concer ning medical conditions which are severely \ndebilitating and/or life threatening and for whic h therapeutic options are limited or non-exist ent, as in the case of \nrare and ultra-rare diseases. \n(11)  The risk to subject safety in a clinical trial mainly stem s from two sources: the investig ational medicinal product \nand the inter vention. Many clinical trials, however , pose only a minimal additional risk to subject safety compared \nto normal clinical practice. This is particularly the case where the investig ational medicinal product is covered by \na mark eting author isation, that is the quality , safety and efficacy has already been assessed in the course of the \nmark eting author isation procedure"" or, if that product is not used in accordance with the term s of the marketing \nauthor isation, that use is evidence- based and suppor ted by published scientific evidence on the safety and effi\xad\ncacy of that product, and the inter vention poses only very limited additional risk to the subject compared to \nnormal clinical practice. Those low-inte rvention clinical trials are often of crucial impor tance for assessing stand \xad\nard treatments and diagnoses, thereby optimising the use of medicinal products and thus contr ibuting to a high \nlevel of public health. Those clinical trials should be subject to less stringent rules, as regards monitori ng, require \xad\nments for the cont ents of the mast er file and traceability of investigat ional medicinal products. In order to ensure \nsubject safety they should however be subject to the same application procedure as any other clinical trial. The \npublished scientific evidence suppor ting the safety and efficacy of an inve stigational medicinal product not used \nin accordance with the term s of the mark eting author isation could include high quality data published in scien \xad\ntific jour nal articles, as well as national, regional or institutional treatment protocols, health technology assess \xad\nment repor ts or other appropr iate evidence. 27.5.2014 L 158/2 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     \n(1)Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 1999 on orphan medicinal products \n(OJ L 18, 22.1.2000, p. 1).

8,What is the requirement for traceability of investigational medicinal products in clinical trials under the new regulation?,"The regulation requires that investigational medicinal products used in clinical trials are traceable throughout the trial, using a specific labelling system and tracking documents to ensure the authenticity of the products and the correct investigation protocol is followed.",,"['I \n(Legislativ e acts) \nREGUL ATIONS \nREGUL ATION (EU) No 536/2014 OF THE EUR OPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL \nof 16 Apr il 2014 \non clinical trials on medicinal products for human use, and repealing Directiv e 2001/20/EC \n(Text with EEA relevance) \nTHE EUR OPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUR OPEAN UNION, \nHaving regar d to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 114 and 168(4)(c) \nthereof, \nHaving regar d to the proposal from the European Commission, \nAfter transmission of the draf t legislative act to the national parliaments, \nHaving regar d to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committ ee (1), \nAfter consulting the Committ ee of the Regions, \nActing in accordance with the ordinar y legislative procedure (2), \nWhereas: \n(1)  In a clinical trial the rights, safety , dignity and well-being of subjects should be protect ed and the data generat ed \nshould be reliable and robust. The inter ests of the subjects should alwa ys take priority over all other interests. \n(2)  In order to allow for independent control as to whether these principles are adhered to, a clinical trial should be \nsubject to prior author isation. \n(3)  The existing definition of a clinical trial as contained in Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and of \nthe Council (3) should be clarified. For that purpose, the concept of clinical trial should be more precisely defined \nby introducing the broader concept of ‘clinical study’ of which the clinical trial is a catego ry. That catego ry \nshould be defined on the basis of specific criteria. This approach takes due account of intern ational guidelines, \nand is in line with the Union law governing medicinal products, whic h builds on the dichotom y of ‘clinical trial’ \nand ‘non-int erventional study’ . \n(4)  Directive 2001/20/EC aims to simplify and harmonise the administrative provisions governing clinical trials in \nthe Union. However , exper ience shows that a harmonised approach to the regulation of clinical trials has only \nbeen partly achieved. This make s it in particular difficult to perform a given clinical trial in several Member 27.5.2014 L 158/1 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     \n(1)OJ C 44, 15.2.2013, p. 99. \n(2)Position of the European Parliament of 3 Apr il 2014 (not yet published in the Official Jour nal) and decision of the Council of 14 Apr il \n2014. \n(3)Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 Apr il 2001 on the appro ximation of the laws, regulations and \nadministrative provisions of the Member States relating to the implementation of good clinical practice in the conduct of clinical trials on \nmedicinal products for human use (OJ L 121, 1.5.2001, p. 34). States. Scientific development, however , sugges ts that future clinical trials will target more specifi c patient popula \xad\ntions, such as subgroups identif ied through genomic information. In order to include a suffi cient number of \npatients for such clinical trials it may be necessar y to involve many , or all, Member State s. The new procedures \nfor the author isation of clinical trials should stimulate the inclusion of as man y Member States as possible. There \xad\nfore, in order to simplify the procedures for the submission of an application dossier for the author isation of a \nclinical trial, the multiple submission of largely identical information should be avoided and replaced by the \nsubmission of one application dossier to all the Member States concer ned through a sing le submission portal. \nGiven that clinical trials carried out in a sing le Member State are equally impor tant to European clinical research, \nthe application dossier for such clinical trials should also be submitte d through that sing le portal. \n(5)  As regar ds Directive 2001/20/EC, exper ience also indicates that the legal form of a Regulation would present \nadvantag es for sponsors and investigat ors, for example in the context of clinical trials taking place in more than \none Member State, since they will be able to rely on its provisions directly , but also in the cont ext of safety \nrepor ting and labelling of investig ational medicinal products. Divergences of approach among diffe rent Member \nStates will be theref ore kept to a minimum. \n(6) The Member State s concer ned should cooperate in assessing a request for author isation of a clinical trial. This co\xad\noperation should not include aspects of an intrinsically national nature, such as informed consent. \n(7)  In order to avoid administrative dela ys for starting a clinical trial, the procedure to be used should be flexible and \nefficient, without compromising patient safety or public health. \n(8)  The timelines for assessing an application dossier for clinical trials should be sufficient to assess the file while, at \nthe same time, ensur ing quic k access to new , inno vative treatments and ensur ing that the Union remains an \nattractive place for conducting clinical trials. Agai nst this back ground, Directive 2001/20/EC introduced the \nconcep t of tacit author isation. This concep t should be maintained in order to ensure that timelines are adhered \nto. In the event of a public health crisis, Member States should have the possibility to assess and author ise a clin\xad\nical trial application swif tly. No minimal timelines for appro val should theref ore be established. \n(9)  Clinical trials for the development of orphan medicinal products as defined in Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 of \nthe European Parliament and of the Council (1) and of medicinal products addressed to subjects affect ed by \nsevere, debilitating and often life-thr eatening diseases affect ing no more than one person in 50 000 in the Union \n(ultra-rare diseases) should be foste red. \n(10)  Member States should efficiently assess all clinical trials applications within the given timelines. A rapid yet in- \ndepth assessment is of particular impor tance for clinical trials concer ning medical conditions which are severely \ndebilitating and/or life threatening and for whic h therapeutic options are limited or non-exist ent, as in the case of \nrare and ultra-rare diseases. \n(11)  The risk to subject safety in a clinical trial mainly stem s from two sources: the investig ational medicinal product \nand the inter vention. Many clinical trials, however , pose only a minimal additional risk to subject safety compared \nto normal clinical practice. This is particularly the case where the investig ational medicinal product is covered by \na mark eting author isation, that is the quality , safety and efficacy has already been assessed in the course of the \nmark eting author isation procedure"" or, if that product is not used in accordance with the term s of the marketing \nauthor isation, that use is evidence- based and suppor ted by published scientific evidence on the safety and effi\xad\ncacy of that product, and the inter vention poses only very limited additional risk to the subject compared to \nnormal clinical practice. Those low-inte rvention clinical trials are often of crucial impor tance for assessing stand \xad\nard treatments and diagnoses, thereby optimising the use of medicinal products and thus contr ibuting to a high \nlevel of public health. Those clinical trials should be subject to less stringent rules, as regards monitori ng, require \xad\nments for the cont ents of the mast er file and traceability of investigat ional medicinal products. In order to ensure \nsubject safety they should however be subject to the same application procedure as any other clinical trial. The \npublished scientific evidence suppor ting the safety and efficacy of an inve stigational medicinal product not used \nin accordance with the term s of the mark eting author isation could include high quality data published in scien \xad\ntific jour nal articles, as well as national, regional or institutional treatment protocols, health technology assess \xad\nment repor ts or other appropr iate evidence. 27.5.2014 L 158/2 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     \n(1)Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 1999 on orphan medicinal products \n(OJ L 18, 22.1.2000, p. 1).

Integral Drug -Device Combinations  \n2.1.  When is my medical device considered to form an integral product with a medicinal \nproduct?  Rev. May 2024  \nThere are two types of iDDCs8 according to MDR Articles 1(8) and 1(9) (see also Question 1.1).  \n1. A medical device that incorporates, as an integral part, a substance which, if used separately, would \nbe considered a medicinal product and where the action of that substance is principal, the integral \nproduct will be regulated as a medicinal product (seco nd subparagraph of Article 1(8)). Examples \ninclude an ingestible sensor that is incorporated  into a medicinal product.  \n2. If a medical device used to administer a medicinal product is  placed on the market in such a way \nthat the  two constituents parts (the medical device and medicinal product)  form a single integral \nproduct which is intended exclusively for use in the given combination and which is not reusable, \nthat single integral product shall be governed by Directive 2001/83/EC or Regulation (EC) No \n726/2004, as applicable. The second paragraph  of Article 1(9) of the MDR sets out three cumulative \nconditions that need to be satisfied at the moment of placing on the market:  \ni. the device and the medicinal product form a single integral product  when placed on the market , \nii. the single integral product is intended exclusively for use in the given combination , \niii. the single integral product is not reusable.  \nBelow are provided some examples.  \nFor medicinal products meeting either one or both of the above definitions , the integral product shall \nbe governed by Directive 2001/83/EC or Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, as applicable . However, the \nrelevant general safety and performance requirements set out in Annex I to Regulation  (EU) 2017/745 \nshall apply as far as the safety and performance of the device part of the integral product is concerned.  \n \n8 so-called ‘integral medicinal products’ in the EMA Guideline on quality documentation for medicinal products when used \nwith a medical device  (EMA/CHMP/QWP/BWP/259165/2019)   \nQuestions & Answers for applicants, marketing authorisation holders of medicinal \nproducts and notified bodies with respect to the implementation of the Regulations on \nmedical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices (Regulations (EU) 2017/745 \nand (E    \nEMA/37991/2019 Rev.4 Page 8/23 \n Examples of integral products which are not reusable are pre -filled syringes, pre -filled pens, nebuli sers \npre-charged with a specific medicinal product, nasal and oromucosal sprays, patches for transdermal \ndrug delivery , pre-filled inhalers  and co-packaged pre-filled syringe with solvent  (e.g. water for \ninjections)  used for administration of the reconstituted medicinal product . \nIn certain cases, the following components would be assessed by competent authorities in accordance \nwith the requirements of :  \n- a container closure system e.g.  eye drops nozzle without measuring function , syringe for \nreconstitution (without purpose for administration of the medicinal product)  or syringe  without \nmeasuring function  specifically intended to transfer into an IV bag  or \n-  excipient s used in the manufacture of the finished medicinal product e.g. in some implants and \nsome transdermal patches  (using passive diffusion),  \nNote: the above examples are provided as a guide, however some devices could be classified differently \ndue to additional features and functionality.

May 2024  \nEMA/NCAs strongly recommend submitting the declaration of conformity / EU certificate / notified body \nopinion at the time of submission of  the dossier of the initial marketing authorisation application for the \nmedicinal product to facilitate a smooth running of the procedure. In case the applicant cannot provide \nthe required documentation at the time of MAA submission, the relevant documents  must be provided \nbefore an opinion on the medicinal product application can be issued. Applicants should discuss their \nplans to provide the required documentation during the EMA/NCA pre -submission meeting. The \nabsence of the required documentation may res ult in additional clock stops during the procedure.  \n \n2.4.  Can I provide a notified body opinion concluding on partial compliance with the GSPR ?  \nWhat is the scope of the  notified body opinion ? New May 2024  \nA notified body opinion concluding on partial compliance cannot be accepted as the CHMP and the \nNCAs do not have the remit of assessing compliance of the device part with the General Safety and \nPerformance requirements ( GSPR ). This can hence lead to an evaluation issue  and an updated notified \nbody opinion confirming full compliance with the relevant GSPRs will need to be provided  prior to the \nissuance of  an opinion on the medicinal product .  \nQuestions & Answers for applicants, marketing authorisation holders of medicinal \nproducts and notified bodies with respect to the implementation of the Regulations on \nmedical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices (Regulations (EU) 2017/745 \nand (E    \nEMA/37991/2019 Rev.4 Page 10/23 \n Furthermore, the scope of the n otified body opinion should correspond to the intended purpose  of the \ndevice for the particular marketing authorisation application . \n \n2.5.  How does Article 117 of the MDR impact iDDCs  authorised under MDD ?  Rev. May 2024  \nAnnex I to Directive 2001/83/EC, point 12 of section 3.2, as amended by Article 117 of MDR, is not \nintended to apply retrospectiv ely to iDDCs  already authorised or to those MAAs that have been already \nsubmitted prior to 26 May 2021.  \nHowever, if after the granting of the marketing authorisation there is a  major change to  a device such \nas in its design , performance, safety  or intended purpose of the device (part) that may have a significant \nimpact on the delivery or the quality, safety, or efficacy of the medicinal product , or a new device  is \nintroduced , any required declaration of conformity / EU certificate / notified body opinion should be \nsubmitted as part of the appropriate regulatory procedure to EMA/NCA (see also Q2. 6). \nAs for any other changes, the MAH should determine whether there is a potential impact on  the delivery,  \nquality, safety and/or efficacy of the iDDC. If the MAH determines that the change impacts the registered \ninformation, a variation application according to the variation guideline will be required. If the change \ndoes not impact the registered information but the MAH concludes that there is an im pact on the quality, \nsafety and/or efficacy of the iDDC, a variation application must also be submitted.   \nIn case of change  to the design , performance  or intended purpose of the device (part) or other changes \nto the medicinal product that may affect the medical device , the MAH should  assess and provide a \njustification whether the change has no significant impact on the safety or performance of the device to \njustify the absence of a notified body opinion,  EU certificate or declaration of conformity in accordance \nwith the MDR, as appropriate. Otherwise, an updated or new proof of compliance with the MDR should \nbe provided . \nIn cases where the need for a variation and/or the category of the change is unclear, it is recommended \nthat the national competent authority  for medicinal products  that issued the marketing authorisation is \nconsulted.  \nIn line with the advice provided in the EMA Q&A for Post-authorisation procedural advice for users of the \ncentralised procedure , given the relatively short timelines for variations procedures, the (new/updated) \nEU declaration of conformity / EU certificate issued by a designated notified body / notified body opinion \nfor medical devices should be provided at the time of submission of the application to avoid any delays \nof the procedure.  \n \n2.6.  Will I need to provide a (new or updated) EU declaration of conformity/certificate of \nconformity issued by a notified body/notified body opinion if there are changes to the device \n(or device part) after the initial marketing authorisation of the integral DDC? Rev. May 2024  \nArticle 117 requirement applies post -authorisation to all marketing authorisations, irrespective whether \nalready compliant with Annex I to Directive 2001/83/EC, point 12 of section 3.2, as amended by Article \n117 MDR at the time of the initial MAA, in case of  major  changes to a device  that may affect  significantly  \nthe safety or performance of the device part or the intended use of the device.

However, it is understood that co-packaged \nmedical devices , in particular class I and class IIa (such as dosing devices like measuring spoons, \nmeasuring cups, or measuring syringes …), can be provided in bulk by the device manufacturer without \nan individual packaging  and will  not contain their own packaging  or IFU , pursuant to Annex I, section \n23.1(d). These devices are by nature small and direct marking of any information on the device itself \ncan be  challenging or technically not feasible . \nConsidering that the product information annexes  (which includes the SmPC, labelling and package \nleaflet)  of the medicinal product must not include the required labelling information of the medical device  \n(see Q&A 3.2) , the aim of the below proposed solutions  is to provide for an acceptable way to include \nthe latter information.  \nA. Provide a separate, additional, leaflet within the packaging of the medicinal product, to provide  \nmedical device administrative information  as per the MDR . This option will result in two separate \nleaflets included in the secondary packaging, i.e. the package leaflet (PL) of the medicinal product, \nas well as the leaflet containing the medical device administrative information. It is recommended to \ninclude a cross-reference  to the other leaflet to avoid that one of the two leaflets is overlooked.  \nThe above option is not preferred where  several devices  are co-packaged together with the medicinal \nproduct . Having several leaflets for different devices in the same package could be confusing for the \nend-user.  \nB. Attach t he leaflet containing the medical device administrative information to the package leaflet of \nthe medicinal product and place it within the secondary package of the medicinal product  as one \nsingle folded component.  To implement this option manufacturers shall consider the following:  \n• the leaflet containing the medical device administrative information should be clearly \ndifferentiated from the package leaflet of the medicinal product. This can be achi eved by adding \nthe leaflet containing the medical device administrative information  as a tear -off section at the \nend of the printed package leaflet.  \n• the product information annexes (SmPC, labelling and package leaflet) of the medicinal product, \nwhich is co -packaged with a medical device, should follow the requirements of Directive \n2001/83/EC and should not include any administrative information of the device as laid down by \nMDR.  \n• the purpose of the section containing administrative information of the device should  be clearly \nindicated by using a relevant subheading , e.g. entitled ”<Device name > specific  information” . \n \nC. Affix a fold out vignette /sticker  containing device -specific information directly onto the device itself , \nor on the packaging of each device, when available.   \nThe following points should be considered when including a fold out vignette/sticker:  ""]"

Combinations of medicinal products and medical devices  \n1.1.  What regulatory framework does a product incorporating both medicinal product and \nmedical device fall under? Rev. May 2024  \nProducts which combine a medicinal product (or substance) and a medical device are regulated either \nby Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices or Directive 2001/83/EC  relating to medicinal products \nfor human use , depending on their principal mode of action. Certain combinations of medicinal products \nand medical devices are governed by or require consultation of EMA or a national competent authority  \nfor medicinal products (NCA) , as laid down in Articles 1(8) and 1(9) of the MDR.  \nThe regulatory framework for devices incorporating medicinal substances as an integral part is laid down \nin Article 1(8) of MDR:  \n• Where the action of the medicinal substance is ancillary to the action of the medical device, the \nproduct is regulated as a medical device and must be CE marked. For these combination s, a \nscientific opinion on the quality and safety of the ancillary substance including the benefit or risk \nof its incorporation  in the device  must be provided from one of the national competent authorities  \nfor medicinal products  or from the EMA (referred to collectively as medicines authority) before a \nnotified body can issue a  EU certificate. For more information  on the consultation procedure by \nEMA and for a list of products previously reviewed by EMA, please see EMA webpage on Ancillary \nmedicinal substances in medical devices . \n• Where the action of the medicinal substance is principal  and not ancillary to the action of the \nmedical device, the  integral  drug device combination  (iDDC) is governed under the medicinal \nproducts framework  and are referred to as iDDCs in the Q&A hereafter7. In that case, the relevant \ngeneral safety and performance requirements of the Annex I of the MDR apply to the device part  \nof the iDDC.   \nThe regulatory framework for medical devices intended to administer medicinal products is laid down in \nArticle 1(9) MDR:  \n• If the medicinal product and administration device are marketed as a single integral product  \nintended exclusively for use in the given combination  and is not reusable , the iDDC is \ngoverned under the medicinal products framework. In that case, the relevant general safety and \nperformance requirements of Annex I of the MDR apply to the device part.   \n• In all other cases (e.g. where the medical device is co -packaged with the medicinal product or \nwhen the product information of the medicinal product refers to a specific device to be used and \nthe device is obtained separately ), the administration device is governed by the medical device \nframework. These administration devices must meet the requirements of the MDR and will need \nto be CE marked.  \nFor the purpose of this document, integral products falling within MDR Article 1(8) second subparagraph \nand 1(9) second subparagraph, and for which the principal mode of action is  pharmacologic al, metabolic \nor immunologic al, are regulated under the medicinal products framework.  \n \n7 so-called ‘integral medicinal products’ in the EMA Guideline on quality documentation for medicinal products when used \nwith a medical device  (EMA/CHMP/QWP/BWP/259165/2019)   \nQuestions & Answers for applicants, marketing authorisation holders of medicinal \nproducts and notified bodies with respect to the implementation of the Regulations on \nmedical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices (Regulations (EU) 2017/745 \nand (E    \nEMA/37991/2019 Rev.4 Page 6/23 \n There are cases where a medicinal product and a medical device are placed on the market in the same \nsecondary packaging but do not form an integral product, for example, a vial containing a medicinal \nproduct solution with an (empty) CE marked sterile syrin ge. These are refe rred as a medicine with a co -\npackaged device. This product is not considered a n iDCC as the medical device falls under the first \nsubparagraph of Article 1(9) of the MDR. Furthermore, when a medical device is referenced in the product \ninformation of a medicinal product, for a use in combination  with the  medicinal product , but the two \nproducts are not placed on the EU market within the same secondary packaging,  requirements for these \nproducts are covered in section 3 of this Q&A.  \nOf note, IVD kits may not include medicinal products. If an IVD or an IVD kit is intended to be  used with \na medicinal product and the products are co -packaged, th e combination with the medicinal product may \nnot be qualified as an IVD kit. Each product must comply with its corresponding legislation.  \n1.2.  How do I choose a notified body for my integral drug -device combination? Rev. May \n2024  \nA notified body within the European Union (EU) is a third-party conformity assessment body designated , \nby an EU Member State  authority , to carry out conformity assessment activities regarding medical \ndevices  and/or in-vitro diagnostics  (IVDs)  in accordance with the MDR and/or IVDR before being placed \non the Union market. Companies are free to choose any notified body; the only criterion is that the \nnotified body must be designated to carry out the conformity assessment procedure for the particular \nmedical d evice for which a certification or notified body opinion is sought ; this is defined by the notified \nbody’s designation codes . Applicants can check the NANDO  (New Approach Notified and Designated \nOrganisations) website, by clicking on ‘Legislation’ and select the relevant Directive/Regulation to search \nfor a designated notified body according to the codes/scope needed.  \n1.3 How to obtain advice on the qualification/classification of my drug -device combination , \nespecially for borderline products ? New May 2024 \nBorderline products are those where it is not clear  which regulatory framework applies , i.e., wheth er \nthey fall under the medical device framework  or the pharmaceutical framework .  \nThe demarcation between the MDR on one hand and the pharmaceutical legislation  on the other hand \nis crucial for applying the appropriate set of requirements.  \nThe qualification/classification of a borderline product (e.g. whether it should be regulated as a \nmedicinal product or as a medical device) lies with the national competent authorities for medicinal \nproducts and/or medical devices.  \nSeveral provisions to establish the demarcation between the two legal frameworks have been laid \ndown in the MDR and the Directive 2001/83/EC  and explanations and examples clarifying these \nprovisions can be found in MDCG 2022 – 5 Guidance on borderline between medical devices and \nmedicinal products under Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices . In addition, the MDCG Manual \non borderline and classification for medical devices under Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical \ndevices and Regulation (EU) 2017/746 on in vitro  diagnostic medical devices  records the views of the \nMember State members of the  MDCG  Borderline and Classification Working Group regarding the \nregulatory status of a product (see Section 1.1.2 regarding the borderline between medical devices and \nmedicinal products).  \nQualification and risk classification of medical devices should be agreed with the notified  body, if \napplicable .

The EU declaration of \nconformity should be updated accordingly, if necessary.  \n• For devices covered under an MDR EU certificate  issued by a notified body:  if the \nassessment of changes leads to the issuance of a new/supplemented EU certificate according to \nthe requirements established in the relevant annexes (Annexes IX, X, XI ) of the MDR , the EU \ncertificate must be provided as part of a n appropriate  post-authorisation  regulatory  procedure.    \n• For devices holding a notified body opinion : if the assessment of changes lead to the \nissuance of a new notified body opinion, the new notified body opinion must be provided as part \nof an appropriate  post-authorisation regulatory procedure.  \nContractual arrangements between the notified body and the device manufacturer address the \nnotification obligation and the oversight of changes to the device in the context of the life cycle \nmanagement of a  EU certificate .  \nFor a notified body opinion in the absence of a contractual arrangement between the notified body and \nthe MAH, it is the responsibility of the MAH to determine when a new or updated NB opinion is needed \nin support of a change to the device or its intended use . The MAH is responsible for liaising  with the EMA \nor the NCA for the iDDC. \nAs for any other changes, the MAH should determine whether there is a potential impact on , the delivery,  \nquality , safety and/or efficacy of the iDDC. If the MAH determines that the change impacts the registered \ninformation, the MAH will have to submit a variation application according to the variation guideline. If \nthe change does not impact the registered information but the MAH concludes that there is an impact \non the delivery, quality, safety and/or efficacy of the iDDC, the MAH must also submit  a variat ion \napplication .  \nIn order to support identification of situations where a new or revised notified body  opinion  for the \ndevice part of an iDDC  is anticipated , the following guidance is provide d, however this is without \nprejudice of the specificities of  the concerned product case  and the fact that assessment of compliance \nwith the general safety and performance requirements (GSPRs) of the device remain s the remit of the \nnotified body.    \nQuestions & Answers for applicants, marketing authorisation holders of medicinal \nproducts and notified bodies with respect to the implementation of the Regulations on \nmedical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices (Regulations (EU) 2017/745 \nand (E    \nEMA/37991/2019 Rev.4 Page 12/23 \n In case of a  EU certificate  or device manufacturer’s declaration of conformity (DoC), the MAH should \nfollow the MDR requirements for the maintenance of the EU certificate or DoC.   \nAs a guiding approach, a  new or revised notified body opinion  for the device part of an iDDC  is: \n1) required when a new device is introduced with a line extension or variation;  \n2) expected when major  changes are introduced to an existing device, such as : \n- change to its design  ; \n- Addition or replacement of an integral device (part)  \n- change to its performance characteristics;  \n- change to its intended purpose  such as  a different patient population and/or new user (e.g. \nhome versus hospital setting) and/or new usability study, and/or significantly different \ninstructions for  use. \nwhich may  have a significant impact on the delivery or the quality, safety, or efficacy of the medicinal \nproduct . \n3) expected in case of changes to the medicinal product which may impact the performance or safety \nof a device , for example the introduction of a new finished product formulation resulting in different \nviscosity significantly affecting device performance.  \nIn case a change or combination of changes to the  device part of an iDDC  and/or its intended use is \n(are) not considered to require a new or revised notified body  opinion , applicants are expected to \nprovide a justification and risk assessment in Module 3.2.R. Depending on the device change(s) and \nconsidering safe and accurate administration and performance, the impact on the Quality Target \nProduct Profile (QTPP), Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) and control strategy for the iDDC should be \nconsidered.  \nIn case of doubt regarding the need to provide a new or revised notified body  opinion  (or DoC or EU \nCertificate)  to support a variation or line extension  and where the need for  a variation and/or the \ncategory of the change is unclear , applicants are strongly recommended to liaise with the national \ncompetent authorities  for medicinal products well in advance during the pre -submission phase.  \nIn line with the advice provided in the EMA Q&A for Post-authorisation procedural advice for use rs of the \ncentralised procedure , given the relatively short timelines for variations procedures, the (new/updated) \nEU declaration of conformity  /EU certificate issued by a designated notified body  / notified body opinion \nfor medical devices should be provided at the time of submission of the application to avoid any delays \nof the procedure.  If not available at submission, it will be legally required before CHMP Opinion (line \nextension and Type II variations) or Notification (Type IB variations).

Combinations of medicinal products and medical devices  \n1.1.  What regulatory framework does a product incorporating both medicinal product and \nmedical device fall under? Rev. May 2024  \nProducts which combine a medicinal product (or substance) and a medical device are regulated either \nby Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices or Directive 2001/83/EC  relating to medicinal products \nfor human use , depending on their principal mode of action. Certain combinations of medicinal products \nand medical devices are governed by or require consultation of EMA or a national competent authority  \nfor medicinal products (NCA) , as laid down in Articles 1(8) and 1(9) of the MDR.  \nThe regulatory framework for devices incorporating medicinal substances as an integral part is laid down \nin Article 1(8) of MDR:  \n• Where the action of the medicinal substance is ancillary to the action of the medical device, the \nproduct is regulated as a medical device and must be CE marked. For these combination s, a \nscientific opinion on the quality and safety of the ancillary substance including the benefit or risk \nof its incorporation  in the device  must be provided from one of the national competent authorities  \nfor medicinal products  or from the EMA (referred to collectively as medicines authority) before a \nnotified body can issue a  EU certificate. For more information  on the consultation procedure by \nEMA and for a list of products previously reviewed by EMA, please see EMA webpage on Ancillary \nmedicinal substances in medical devices . \n• Where the action of the medicinal substance is principal  and not ancillary to the action of the \nmedical device, the  integral  drug device combination  (iDDC) is governed under the medicinal \nproducts framework  and are referred to as iDDCs in the Q&A hereafter7. In that case, the relevant \ngeneral safety and performance requirements of the Annex I of the MDR apply to the device part  \nof the iDDC.   \nThe regulatory framework for medical devices intended to administer medicinal products is laid down in \nArticle 1(9) MDR:  \n• If the medicinal product and administration device are marketed as a single integral product  \nintended exclusively for use in the given combination  and is not reusable , the iDDC is \ngoverned under the medicinal products framework. In that case, the relevant general safety and \nperformance requirements of Annex I of the MDR apply to the device part.   \n• In all other cases (e.g. where the medical device is co -packaged with the medicinal product or \nwhen the product information of the medicinal product refers to a specific device to be used and \nthe device is obtained separately ), the administration device is governed by the medical device \nframework. These administration devices must meet the requirements of the MDR and will need \nto be CE marked.  \nFor the purpose of this document, integral products falling within MDR Article 1(8) second subparagraph \nand 1(9) second subparagraph, and for which the principal mode of action is  pharmacologic al, metabolic \nor immunologic al, are regulated under the medicinal products framework.  \n \n7 so-called ‘integral medicinal products’ in the EMA Guideline on quality documentation for medicinal products when used \nwith a medical device  (EMA/CHMP/QWP/BWP/259165/2019)   \nQuestions & Answers for applicants, marketing authorisation holders of medicinal \nproducts and notified bodies with respect to the implementation of the Regulations on \nmedical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices (Regulations (EU) 2017/745 \nand (E    \nEMA/37991/2019 Rev.4 Page 6/23 \n There are cases where a medicinal product and a medical device are placed on the market in the same \nsecondary packaging but do not form an integral product, for example, a vial containing a medicinal \nproduct solution with an (empty) CE marked sterile syrin ge. These are refe rred as a medicine with a co -\npackaged device. This product is not considered a n iDCC as the medical device falls under the first \nsubparagraph of Article 1(9) of the MDR. Furthermore, when a medical device is referenced in the product \ninformation of a medicinal product, for a use in combination  with the  medicinal product , but the two \nproducts are not placed on the EU market within the same secondary packaging,  requirements for these \nproducts are covered in section 3 of this Q&A.  \nOf note, IVD kits may not include medicinal products. If an IVD or an IVD kit is intended to be  used with \na medicinal product and the products are co -packaged, th e combination with the medicinal product may \nnot be qualified as an IVD kit. Each product must comply with its corresponding legislation.  \n1.2.  How do I choose a notified body for my integral drug -device combination? Rev. May \n2024  \nA notified body within the European Union (EU) is a third-party conformity assessment body designated , \nby an EU Member State  authority , to carry out conformity assessment activities regarding medical \ndevices  and/or in-vitro diagnostics  (IVDs)  in accordance with the MDR and/or IVDR before being placed \non the Union market. Companies are free to choose any notified body; the only criterion is that the \nnotified body must be designated to carry out the conformity assessment procedure for the particular \nmedical d evice for which a certification or notified body opinion is sought ; this is defined by the notified \nbody’s designation codes . Applicants can check the NANDO  (New Approach Notified and Designated \nOrganisations) website, by clicking on ‘Legislation’ and select the relevant Directive/Regulation to search \nfor a designated notified body according to the codes/scope needed.  \n1.3 How to obtain advice on the qualification/classification of my drug -device combination , \nespecially for borderline products ? New May 2024 \nBorderline products are those where it is not clear  which regulatory framework applies , i.e., wheth er \nthey fall under the medical device framework  or the pharmaceutical framework .  \nThe demarcation between the MDR on one hand and the pharmaceutical legislation  on the other hand \nis crucial for applying the appropriate set of requirements.  \nThe qualification/classification of a borderline product (e.g. whether it should be regulated as a \nmedicinal product or as a medical device) lies with the national competent authorities for medicinal \nproducts and/or medical devices.  \nSeveral provisions to establish the demarcation between the two legal frameworks have been laid \ndown in the MDR and the Directive 2001/83/EC  and explanations and examples clarifying these \nprovisions can be found in MDCG 2022 – 5 Guidance on borderline between medical devices and \nmedicinal products under Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices . In addition, the MDCG Manual \non borderline and classification for medical devices under Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical \ndevices and Regulation (EU) 2017/746 on in vitro  diagnostic medical devices  records the views of the \nMember State members of the  MDCG  Borderline and Classification Working Group regarding the \nregulatory status of a product (see Section 1.1.2 regarding the borderline between medical devices and \nmedicinal products).  \nQualification and risk classification of medical devices should be agreed with the notified  body, if \napplicable .

Immediate relatives and other categories of persons specified above are also \npresumed to be connected persons but such a presumption is a deeming legal fiction and  \n is rebuttable.  This definition is also intend ed to bring into its ambit persons who may not \nseemingly occupy any position in a company but are in regular touch with the company \nand its officers and are involved in the know of  the company ’s operat ions. It is intended \nto bring within its ambit those w ho would have access to or could access unpublished \nprice sensitive information about any company or class of companies by virtue of any \nconnection that would put them in possession of unpublished price sensitive information.  \n \n(e) ""generally available inf ormation"" means information that is accessible to the \npublic on a non -discriminatory basis;  \n \nNOTE : It is intended to define what constitutes generally available information so \nthat it is easier to crystallize and appreciate what unpublished price sensitive  information \nis.  Information published on the website of a stock exchange, would ordinarily be \nconsidered generally available.   \n \n(f)  “immediate relative” means a spouse of a person, and includes parent, sibling, and \nchild of such person or of the spouse , any of whom is either dependent financially on \nsuch person, or consults such person in taking decisions relating to trading in securities;  \n \nNOTE :  It is intended that the immediate relatives of a “connected person” too \nbecome connected persons for purpos es of these regulations. Indeed, this is  a rebuttable \npresumption . \n \n(g) ""insider"" means any person who is:  \n \ni)  a connected person;  or  \n \nii)  in possession of  or having access to unpublished price sensitive \ninformation;   \n  \n NOTE : Since “generally available i nformation” is defined, it is intended that \nanyone in possession of or having access to unpublished price sensitive information \nshould be considered an “insider” regardless of how one came in possession of or had \naccess to such information. Various circums tances are provided for such a person to \ndemonstrate that he has not indulged in insider trading. Therefore, this definition is \nintended to bring within its reach any person who is in receipt of  or has access to  \nunpublished price sensitive information. The  onus of showing that a certain person was \nin possession of or had access to unpublished price sensitive information at the time of \ntrading would, therefore, be on the person leveling the charge after which the person who \nhas traded when in possession of or having access to unpublished price sensitive \ninformation may demonstrate that he was not in such possession or that he has not traded \nor or he c ould not access or that his trading when in possession of such information was \nsquarely covered by the exonera ting circumstances .   \n \n(h) ""promoter"" shall have the meaning assigned to it under the Securities and \nExchange Board of India (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, \n2[2018] or any modification thereof ; \n \n3[(ha)  ""promoter group"" shall ha ve the meaning assigned to it under the Securities and Exchange \nBoard of India (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2018 or any \nmodification  thereof;]  \n \n4[(5[hb]) “proposed to be listed” shall include securities of an unlisted company : \n(i) if such unlisted company has filed offer documents or other documents, as the \ncase may be, with the Board, stock exchange(s) or registrar of companies in \nconnection with the listing; or  \n                                                           \n2 Substituted for the number “2009” by Securities and Exchange Board of India (Prohibition of Insider Trading) \n(Amendment) Regul ations, 2018 (w.e.f.

REs shall formulate a policy for digital payment products and services with the \napproval of their Board.  The contours of the polic y, while d iscussing the parameters \nof any “ new product ” including its alignment with the overall business strategy and \ninherent risk of the product, risk management/ mitigation measures , compliance \nwith regulatory instructions,  customer experience,  etc., should explicitly discuss \nabout payment security requirements from Functionality, Security and Performance  \n(FSP)  angles such as:  \na) Necessary controls to protect the confidentiality of  customer data and integrity \nof data and processes  associated with the digital product/ services offered;  \nb) Availability of requisite infrastructure e.g. human resources, technology, etc.  \nwith necessary back up;  \nc) Assurance that the p ayment product is built in a secure manner offering robust \nperformance ensuring safety , consistency  and rolled out after necessary testing \nfor achieving  desired FSP;   \nd) Capacity building and expansion with scalability  (to meet the growth for efficient \ntransaction processing) ;   \ne) Minimal customer service disruption with high availability  of systems/ channels  \n(to have minimal technical declines) ; \nf) Efficient and effective dispute resolution mechanism and handling  of customer \ngrievance; and \ng) Adequate and appropriate review mechanism followed by swift corrective \naction, in case any one of the above requirements is hampered or having high \npotential to get hampered.  \n \nThe Board and Senior Management shall be responsible for implementation of this \npolicy . The policy shall  be reviewed periodically, at least on a yearly basis. REs may \nformulate this policy separately for its different digital products or include the same as part of their overall product policy. F urther, the policy document should require \nthat every digital payment product/ services offered address es the mechanics, clear \ndefinition of starting point , critical intermittent stages/ points  and end point in the \ndigital payment cycle, security aspects,  validations till the digital payment is settled, \nclear pictorial representation of digital path and exception handling. In addition,  \nsigning off of the above requirements, mechanism  for carrying out U ser Acceptance \nTests (UAT) in multiple stages before roll out, sign off from multiple stakeholders \n(post UAT) and data archiv al requirements shall also be taken in to account . The \nneed for an external assessment of the entire process including the logic, build and 5 \n security aspects o f the application(s) supporting the digital product should be clearly \narticulated.   \n5. REs shall incorporate appropriate processes into their governance and risk \nmanagement programs for identifying, analysing, monitoring and managing the \nspecific risks, incl uding compliance risk  and fraud risk,  associated with the portfolio \nof digital payment  products and services  on a continual basis and in a holistic \nmanner. The Board/ Senior Management of REs  shall have appropriate \nperformance monitoring systems/ key performance indicators for assessing \nwhether the product or service offered through digital payment  channels meet \noperational and security norms . \n6. As part of this process, the REs shall  define product -level limits on the level of \nacceptable security risk, document specific security objectives and performance \ncriteria including quantitative benchmarks for evaluating the success of the security \nbuilt into the digital payment  product or service, periodically compare actual results \nwith projections and qualitative benchmarks to detect and address adverse trends or concerns in a timely manner  and modify the business plan/  strategy  involving the \nproduct, when appropriate,  based o n the security performance of the product or \nservice.  \n7. REs shall have trained resources  with necessary expertise to manage the digital \npayment  infrastructure. Wherever the REs are dependent on third party service \nproviders, adequate oversight and controls for monitoring the activities of the third \nparty personnel , in line with RBI guidelines  on outsourcing , shall be put in place.   \n8.

REs shall formulate a policy for digital payment products and services with the \napproval of their Board.  The contours of the polic y, while d iscussing the parameters \nof any “ new product ” including its alignment with the overall business strategy and \ninherent risk of the product, risk management/ mitigation measures , compliance \nwith regulatory instructions,  customer experience,  etc., should explicitly discuss \nabout payment security requirements from Functionality, Security and Performance  \n(FSP)  angles such as:  \na) Necessary controls to protect the confidentiality of  customer data and integrity \nof data and processes  associated with the digital product/ services offered;  \nb) Availability of requisite infrastructure e.g. human resources, technology, etc.  \nwith necessary back up;  \nc) Assurance that the p ayment product is built in a secure manner offering robust \nperformance ensuring safety , consistency  and rolled out after necessary testing \nfor achieving  desired FSP;   \nd) Capacity building and expansion with scalability  (to meet the growth for efficient \ntransaction processing) ;   \ne) Minimal customer service disruption with high availability  of systems/ channels  \n(to have minimal technical declines) ; \nf) Efficient and effective dispute resolution mechanism and handling  of customer \ngrievance; and \ng) Adequate and appropriate review mechanism followed by swift corrective \naction, in case any one of the above requirements is hampered or having high \npotential to get hampered.  \n \nThe Board and Senior Management shall be responsible for implementation of this \npolicy . The policy shall  be reviewed periodically, at least on a yearly basis. REs may \nformulate this policy separately for its different digital products or include the same as part of their overall product policy. F urther, the policy document should require \nthat every digital payment product/ services offered address es the mechanics, clear \ndefinition of starting point , critical intermittent stages/ points  and end point in the \ndigital payment cycle, security aspects,  validations till the digital payment is settled, \nclear pictorial representation of digital path and exception handling. In addition,  \nsigning off of the above requirements, mechanism  for carrying out U ser Acceptance \nTests (UAT) in multiple stages before roll out, sign off from multiple stakeholders \n(post UAT) and data archiv al requirements shall also be taken in to account . The \nneed for an external assessment of the entire process including the logic, build and 5 \n security aspects o f the application(s) supporting the digital product should be clearly \narticulated.   \n5. REs shall incorporate appropriate processes into their governance and risk \nmanagement programs for identifying, analysing, monitoring and managing the \nspecific risks, incl uding compliance risk  and fraud risk,  associated with the portfolio \nof digital payment  products and services  on a continual basis and in a holistic \nmanner. The Board/ Senior Management of REs  shall have appropriate \nperformance monitoring systems/ key performance indicators for assessing \nwhether the product or service offered through digital payment  channels meet \noperational and security norms . \n6. As part of this process, the REs shall  define product -level limits on the level of \nacceptable security risk, document specific security objectives and performance \ncriteria including quantitative benchmarks for evaluating the success of the security \nbuilt into the digital payment  product or service, periodically compare actual results \nwith projections and qualitative benchmarks to detect and address adverse trends or concerns in a timely manner  and modify the business plan/  strategy  involving the \nproduct, when appropriate,  based o n the security performance of the product or \nservice.  \n7. REs shall have trained resources  with necessary expertise to manage the digital \npayment  infrastructure. Wherever the REs are dependent on third party service \nproviders, adequate oversight and controls for monitoring the activities of the third \nparty personnel , in line with RBI guidelines  on outsourcing , shall be put in place.   \n8. REs s hall conduct risk assessments with regard to the safety and security of digital \npayment  products and associated processes and services as well as suitability and \nappropriateness of the same vis -a-vis the target users , both prior to establishing the \nservice(s) and regularly thereafter. The risk assessment should take into account – \na) The technology stack and solutions used;  \nb) Known vulnerabilities at each of the touchpoints of the digital product and the \nremedial action taken by the entity;  \nc) Dependence on third party service providers and oversight over such providers;  \nd) Risk arising out of integration of digital payment  platform with other systems  \nboth internal and external to the RE, including c ore system s and systems of \npayment systems operators , etc.;  \ne) The customer experience, convenience and technology adoption required to use such products;  \nf) Reconciliation process ; \ng) Interoperability aspects ; \nh) Data storage, security and privacy protection as per extant laws/ instructions ; ']"

REs may continuously create public awareness on the types of threats and attacks  \nused against the consumers while using digital payment  products  and \nprecautionary measures to safeguard against the same. Customers shall be \ncautioned against c ommonly known threats  in recent times like phishing, vishing, \nreverse -phishing, remote access of mobile devices and educated to secure and \nsafeguard their account details, credentials, PIN, card details, devices , etc.  \n49. REs shall provide digital payment products and services , to a customer only at her/ \nhis option based on specific written or authenticated electronic requisition along with \na positive ac knowledgement  of the terms and conditions .   \n50. REs should provide a mechanism on their mobile and internet banking application \nfor their customers to , with necessary authentication,  identify/  mark a transaction \nas fraudulent for seamless and immediate notification to his RE. On such \nnotification by the customer, th e RE s may endeavour to build the capability for \nseamless/ instant reporting of fraudulent  transactions to the corresponding \nbenefici ary/ counterparty’s RE ; vice-versa have mechanism to receive such \nfraudulent transactions  reported  from other REs . The objective of this mechanism  \nis to accelerate early detection and enable the banking / payment  system to trace \nthe transaction trail and mitigate the loss to the defrauded customer at the earliest \npossible time.   \n \n \n \n \n       15 \n  \nChapter III  \nINTERNET BANKING SECURITY CONTROLS  \nIn addition to the controls prescribed in Chapter II, the following instructions are \napplicable to REs offering/ intending to offer internet banking facility to their customers:  \n51. Internet banking websites are vulnerable to authentication related brute force \nattacks/ applicat ion layer Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Based on the RE’s \nindividual risk/ vulnerability assessment on authentication- related attacks such as \nbrute force/ DoS attacks, REs shall implement additional levels of authentication to \ninternet banking website s uch as adaptive authentication, strong CAPTCHA \n(preferably with anti -bot features) with server -side validation, etc., in order to plug \nthis vulnerability and prevent its exploitation.  Appropriate measures shall be taken \nto prevent DNS cache poisoning attacks  and for secure handling of cookies . Virtual \nkeyboard option should be made available.  \n52. An online session shall be automatically terminated after a fixed period of inactivity.  \n53. Secure delivery of password for login purpose shall be ensured. The password \ngenerated and dispatched by the RE should be valid for a limited period from the date of its creation.  If the password is generated and dispatched by the RE, then , \nthe user shall be compulsorily required to change the password,  on the first login.    \n54. When the internet banking application is accessed through external websites ( eg: \nin case of payment of taxes,  e-commerce transactions , etc.), the procedure f or \nauthentication and the appearance/ look and feel  of the RE’s internet banki ng site \nshould be made uniform as far as possible.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 16 \n Chapter IV  \nMOBILE PAYMENTS APPLICATION SECURITY CONTROLS   \nIn addition to the controls prescribed in Chapter II, the following instructions are \napplicable to the REs offering/ intending to offer mobile banking / mobile payments  \nfacility to their customers  through mobile application:  \n55. On detection of any anomalies or exceptions for which the mobile application was \nnot programmed, the customer shall  be directed to remove the current copy/ \ninstance of the application and proceed with installation of a new copy/ instance of \nthe application.  REs shall be able to verify the version of the mobile application \nbefore the transactions are enabled.   \n56. Specific Controls for mobile  applications include:  \na) Device policy enforcement (allowing app install ation / execution after baseline \nrequirements are met);  \nb) Application secure download/ install;  \nc) Deactivating older application versions in a phased but time bound manner (not \nexceeding six months from the date of release of newer version) i.e., \nmaintaining only one version (excluding the overlap period while phasing out \nolder version) of the mobile application on a platform/ operating system;  \nd) Storage of customer data;  \ne) Device or application encryption;  \nf) Ensuring minimal data collection/ app permissions;  \ng) Application sandbox/  containerisation;   \nh) Ability to identify remote access applications (to the extent possible) and prohibit login access to the mobile application, as a matter of precaution; and   \ni) Code obfuscation.  \n \n57. REs may consider to perform validation on the security and compatibility condition \nof the device/ operating system and the mobile application  to ensure that activities \nrelating to the account  are put through the mobile application in a safe and secure \nmanner.   \n58. REs may explore the feasibility of implementing a code that checks if the device is \nrooted/ jailbroken prior to the installation of the mobile application and disallow the \nmobile application to install/  function if the phone is rooted/ jailbroken.  \n59. Checksum of current  active  version of application  shall be hosted on public platform \nso that users can verify the same.  \n ""]"
