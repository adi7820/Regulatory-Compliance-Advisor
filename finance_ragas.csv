(1) These regulations may be called the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) \nRegulations, 2015 . \n \n(2) These regulations shall come into force on the one hundred and twentieth day from the \ndate of its publication in the Official Gazette.   \n  \nDefinitions . \n2. (1) In these regulations, unless the context otherwise requires, the following words, \nexpressions and derivations therefrom shall have the meanings assigned to them as under: –  \n \n(a) “Act” means the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (15 of 1992);  \n \n(b) “Board” means the Securities and Exchange Board of India;  \n \n(c)  “compliance officer” means any senior officer, designated so  and reporting to the \nboard of directors  or head of the organization  in case board is not there , who is \nfinancially l iterate and is capable of appreciating requirements for legal and regulatory \ncompliance under these regulations  and who shall be responsible for compliance of \npolicies, procedures, maintenance of records, monitoring adherence to the rules for the \npreservat ion of unpublished price sensitive information, monitoring of trades and the \nimplementation of the codes specified in these regulations under the overall supervision \nof the board of  directors of  the listed company or the head of an organization , as the cas e \nmay be . \n \n1[Explanation – For the purpose of this regulation , “financially literate” shall mean a \nperson who has the ability to read and understand basic financial statements i.e. balance \nsheet, profit and loss account, and statement of cash flows ]; \n \n(d) ""connected person"" means ,- \n(i) any person who  is or has during the six months prior to the concerned act been \nassociated with a company, directly or indirectly, in any capacity including  by \nreason of frequent communication with its officers or by being in  any contractual, \nfiduciary or employment relationship  or by being a director, officer or an \nemployee of the company or holds any position  including a professional or \n                                                           \n1 Inserted b y Securities and Exchange Board of India (Prohibition of Insider Trading) (Amendment) Regulations, \n2018  (w.e.f. April 01, 2019)   \n business relationship between himself and the company  whether temporary or \npermanent,  that allows such person , directly or indirectly,  access to unpublished \nprice sensitive information or is reasonably expected to allow such access .  \n \n(ii) Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, the persons falling within \nthe following categories shall be deemed to be connected persons  unless the \ncontrary is established,  -  \n(a). an immediate relative of connected persons specified in clause (i); or  \n(b). a holding company or associate company or subsidiary company; or  \n(c). an intermediary as specified in section 12 of the Act  or an employee or \ndirector thereof ; or  \n(d). an investment company, trustee company, asset management company or \nan employee or director thereof; or  \n(e). an official of a stock exchange or of clearing house or corporation; or  \n(f). a member of board of trus tees of a mutual fund or a member of the board \nof directors of the asset management company of a mutual fund or is an \nemployee thereof; or  \n(g). a member of the board of directors or an employee, of a public financial \ninstitution as defined in section 2 (72) of  the Companies Act , 2013; or \n(h). an official or an employee of a self-regulatory organization recognised or \nauthorized  by the Board ; or \n(i). a banker of the company;  or \n(j). a concern, firm, trust, Hindu undivided family, company or association of \npersons wherein a director of a company or his immediate relative or \nbanker of the company,  has more than ten per cent . of the holding or \ninterest ; \n \nNOTE : It is intended that a connected person is one who has a connection with \nthe company that is expected to put him in possessi on of unpublished price sensitive \ninformation. Immediate relatives and other categories of persons specified above are also \npresumed to be connected persons but such a presumption is a deeming legal fiction and  \n is rebuttable.  This definition is also intend ed to bring into its ambit persons who may not \nseemingly occupy any position in a company but are in regular touch with the company \nand its officers and are involved in the know of  the company ’s operat ions. It is intended \nto bring within its ambit those w ho would have access to or could access unpublished \nprice sensitive information about any company or class of companies by virtue of any \nconnection that would put them in possession of unpublished price sensitive information.  \n \n(e) ""generally available inf ormation"" means information that is accessible to the \npublic on a non -discriminatory basis;  \n \nNOTE : It is intended to define what constitutes generally available information so \nthat it is easier to crystallize and appreciate what unpublished price sensitive  information \nis.  Information published on the website of a stock exchange, would ordinarily be \nconsidered generally available.   \n \n(f)  “immediate relative” means a spouse of a person, and includes parent, sibling, and \nchild of such person or of the spouse , any of whom is either dependent financially on \nsuch person, or consults such person in taking decisions relating to trading in securities;  \n \nNOTE :  It is intended that the immediate relatives of a “connected person” too \nbecome connected persons for purpos es of these regulations. Indeed, this is  a rebuttable \npresumption . \n \n(g) ""insider"" means any person who is:  \n \ni)  a connected person;  or  \n \nii)  in possession of  or having access to unpublished price sensitive \ninformation;   \n  \n NOTE : Since “generally available i nformation” is defined, it is intended that \nanyone in possession of or having access to unpublished price sensitive information \nshould be considered an “insider” regardless of how one came in possession of or had \naccess to such information. Various circums tances are provided for such a person to \ndemonstrate that he has not indulged in insider trading. Therefore, this definition is \nintended to bring within its reach any person who is in receipt of  or has access to  \nunpublished price sensitive information. The  onus of showing that a certain person was \nin possession of or had access to unpublished price sensitive information at the time of \ntrading would, therefore, be on the person leveling the charge after which the person who \nhas traded when in possession of or having access to unpublished price sensitive \ninformation may demonstrate that he was not in such possession or that he has not traded \nor or he c ould not access or that his trading when in possession of such information was \nsquarely covered by the exonera ting circumstances .   \n \n(h) ""promoter"" shall have the meaning assigned to it under the Securities and \nExchange Board of India (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, \n2[2018] or any modification thereof ; \n \n3[(ha)  ""promoter group"" shall ha ve the meaning assigned to it under the Securities and Exchange \nBoard of India (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2018 or any \nmodification  thereof;]  \n \n4[(5[hb]) “proposed to be listed” shall include securities of an unlisted company : \n(i) if such unlisted company has filed offer documents or other documents, as the \ncase may be, with the Board, stock exchange(s) or registrar of companies in \nconnection with the listing; or  \n                                                           \n2 Substituted for the number “2009” by Securities and Exchange Board of India (Prohibition of Insider Trading) \n(Amendment) Regul ations, 2018 (w.e.f.

REs shall formulate a policy for digital payment products and services with the \napproval of their Board.  The contours of the polic y, while d iscussing the parameters \nof any “ new product ” including its alignment with the overall business strategy and \ninherent risk of the product, risk management/ mitigation measures , compliance \nwith regulatory instructions,  customer experience,  etc., should explicitly discuss \nabout payment security requirements from Functionality, Security and Performance  \n(FSP)  angles such as:  \na) Necessary controls to protect the confidentiality of  customer data and integrity \nof data and processes  associated with the digital product/ services offered;  \nb) Availability of requisite infrastructure e.g. human resources, technology, etc.  \nwith necessary back up;  \nc) Assurance that the p ayment product is built in a secure manner offering robust \nperformance ensuring safety , consistency  and rolled out after necessary testing \nfor achieving  desired FSP;   \nd) Capacity building and expansion with scalability  (to meet the growth for efficient \ntransaction processing) ;   \ne) Minimal customer service disruption with high availability  of systems/ channels  \n(to have minimal technical declines) ; \nf) Efficient and effective dispute resolution mechanism and handling  of customer \ngrievance; and \ng) Adequate and appropriate review mechanism followed by swift corrective \naction, in case any one of the above requirements is hampered or having high \npotential to get hampered.  \n \nThe Board and Senior Management shall be responsible for implementation of this \npolicy . The policy shall  be reviewed periodically, at least on a yearly basis. REs may \nformulate this policy separately for its different digital products or include the same as part of their overall product policy. F urther, the policy document should require \nthat every digital payment product/ services offered address es the mechanics, clear \ndefinition of starting point , critical intermittent stages/ points  and end point in the \ndigital payment cycle, security aspects,  validations till the digital payment is settled, \nclear pictorial representation of digital path and exception handling. In addition,  \nsigning off of the above requirements, mechanism  for carrying out U ser Acceptance \nTests (UAT) in multiple stages before roll out, sign off from multiple stakeholders \n(post UAT) and data archiv al requirements shall also be taken in to account . The \nneed for an external assessment of the entire process including the logic, build and 5 \n security aspects o f the application(s) supporting the digital product should be clearly \narticulated.   \n5. REs shall incorporate appropriate processes into their governance and risk \nmanagement programs for identifying, analysing, monitoring and managing the \nspecific risks, incl uding compliance risk  and fraud risk,  associated with the portfolio \nof digital payment  products and services  on a continual basis and in a holistic \nmanner. The Board/ Senior Management of REs  shall have appropriate \nperformance monitoring systems/ key performance indicators for assessing \nwhether the product or service offered through digital payment  channels meet \noperational and security norms . \n6. As part of this process, the REs shall  define product -level limits on the level of \nacceptable security risk, document specific security objectives and performance \ncriteria including quantitative benchmarks for evaluating the success of the security \nbuilt into the digital payment  product or service, periodically compare actual results \nwith projections and qualitative benchmarks to detect and address adverse trends or concerns in a timely manner  and modify the business plan/  strategy  involving the \nproduct, when appropriate,  based o n the security performance of the product or \nservice.  \n7. REs shall have trained resources  with necessary expertise to manage the digital \npayment  infrastructure. Wherever the REs are dependent on third party service \nproviders, adequate oversight and controls for monitoring the activities of the third \nparty personnel , in line with RBI guidelines  on outsourcing , shall be put in place.   \n8.

REs shall formulate a policy for digital payment products and services with the \napproval of their Board.  The contours of the polic y, while d iscussing the parameters \nof any “ new product ” including its alignment with the overall business strategy and \ninherent risk of the product, risk management/ mitigation measures , compliance \nwith regulatory instructions,  customer experience,  etc., should explicitly discuss \nabout payment security requirements from Functionality, Security and Performance  \n(FSP)  angles such as:  \na) Necessary controls to protect the confidentiality of  customer data and integrity \nof data and processes  associated with the digital product/ services offered;  \nb) Availability of requisite infrastructure e.g. human resources, technology, etc.  \nwith necessary back up;  \nc) Assurance that the p ayment product is built in a secure manner offering robust \nperformance ensuring safety , consistency  and rolled out after necessary testing \nfor achieving  desired FSP;   \nd) Capacity building and expansion with scalability  (to meet the growth for efficient \ntransaction processing) ;   \ne) Minimal customer service disruption with high availability  of systems/ channels  \n(to have minimal technical declines) ; \nf) Efficient and effective dispute resolution mechanism and handling  of customer \ngrievance; and \ng) Adequate and appropriate review mechanism followed by swift corrective \naction, in case any one of the above requirements is hampered or having high \npotential to get hampered.  \n \nThe Board and Senior Management shall be responsible for implementation of this \npolicy . The policy shall  be reviewed periodically, at least on a yearly basis. REs may \nformulate this policy separately for its different digital products or include the same as part of their overall product policy. F urther, the policy document should require \nthat every digital payment product/ services offered address es the mechanics, clear \ndefinition of starting point , critical intermittent stages/ points  and end point in the \ndigital payment cycle, security aspects,  validations till the digital payment is settled, \nclear pictorial representation of digital path and exception handling. In addition,  \nsigning off of the above requirements, mechanism  for carrying out U ser Acceptance \nTests (UAT) in multiple stages before roll out, sign off from multiple stakeholders \n(post UAT) and data archiv al requirements shall also be taken in to account . The \nneed for an external assessment of the entire process including the logic, build and 5 \n security aspects o f the application(s) supporting the digital product should be clearly \narticulated.   \n5. REs shall incorporate appropriate processes into their governance and risk \nmanagement programs for identifying, analysing, monitoring and managing the \nspecific risks, incl uding compliance risk  and fraud risk,  associated with the portfolio \nof digital payment  products and services  on a continual basis and in a holistic \nmanner. The Board/ Senior Management of REs  shall have appropriate \nperformance monitoring systems/ key performance indicators for assessing \nwhether the product or service offered through digital payment  channels meet \noperational and security norms . \n6. As part of this process, the REs shall  define product -level limits on the level of \nacceptable security risk, document specific security objectives and performance \ncriteria including quantitative benchmarks for evaluating the success of the security \nbuilt into the digital payment  product or service, periodically compare actual results \nwith projections and qualitative benchmarks to detect and address adverse trends or concerns in a timely manner  and modify the business plan/  strategy  involving the \nproduct, when appropriate,  based o n the security performance of the product or \nservice.  \n7. REs shall have trained resources  with necessary expertise to manage the digital \npayment  infrastructure. Wherever the REs are dependent on third party service \nproviders, adequate oversight and controls for monitoring the activities of the third \nparty personnel , in line with RBI guidelines  on outsourcing , shall be put in place.   \n8. REs s hall conduct risk assessments with regard to the safety and security of digital \npayment  products and associated processes and services as well as suitability and \nappropriateness of the same vis -a-vis the target users , both prior to establishing the \nservice(s) and regularly thereafter. The risk assessment should take into account – \na) The technology stack and solutions used;  \nb) Known vulnerabilities at each of the touchpoints of the digital product and the \nremedial action taken by the entity;  \nc) Dependence on third party service providers and oversight over such providers;  \nd) Risk arising out of integration of digital payment  platform with other systems  \nboth internal and external to the RE, including c ore system s and systems of \npayment systems operators , etc.;  \ne) The customer experience, convenience and technology adoption required to use such products;  \nf) Reconciliation process ; \ng) Interoperability aspects ; \nh) Data storage, security and privacy protection as per extant laws/ instructions ; ']"

REs may continuously create public awareness on the types of threats and attacks  \nused against the consumers while using digital payment  products  and \nprecautionary measures to safeguard against the same. Customers shall be \ncautioned against c ommonly known threats  in recent times like phishing, vishing, \nreverse -phishing, remote access of mobile devices and educated to secure and \nsafeguard their account details, credentials, PIN, card details, devices , etc.  \n49. REs shall provide digital payment products and services , to a customer only at her/ \nhis option based on specific written or authenticated electronic requisition along with \na positive ac knowledgement  of the terms and conditions .   \n50. REs should provide a mechanism on their mobile and internet banking application \nfor their customers to , with necessary authentication,  identify/  mark a transaction \nas fraudulent for seamless and immediate notification to his RE. On such \nnotification by the customer, th e RE s may endeavour to build the capability for \nseamless/ instant reporting of fraudulent  transactions to the corresponding \nbenefici ary/ counterparty’s RE ; vice-versa have mechanism to receive such \nfraudulent transactions  reported  from other REs . The objective of this mechanism  \nis to accelerate early detection and enable the banking / payment  system to trace \nthe transaction trail and mitigate the loss to the defrauded customer at the earliest \npossible time.   \n \n \n \n \n       15 \n  \nChapter III  \nINTERNET BANKING SECURITY CONTROLS  \nIn addition to the controls prescribed in Chapter II, the following instructions are \napplicable to REs offering/ intending to offer internet banking facility to their customers:  \n51. Internet banking websites are vulnerable to authentication related brute force \nattacks/ applicat ion layer Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Based on the RE’s \nindividual risk/ vulnerability assessment on authentication- related attacks such as \nbrute force/ DoS attacks, REs shall implement additional levels of authentication to \ninternet banking website s uch as adaptive authentication, strong CAPTCHA \n(preferably with anti -bot features) with server -side validation, etc., in order to plug \nthis vulnerability and prevent its exploitation.  Appropriate measures shall be taken \nto prevent DNS cache poisoning attacks  and for secure handling of cookies . Virtual \nkeyboard option should be made available.  \n52. An online session shall be automatically terminated after a fixed period of inactivity.  \n53. Secure delivery of password for login purpose shall be ensured. The password \ngenerated and dispatched by the RE should be valid for a limited period from the date of its creation.  If the password is generated and dispatched by the RE, then , \nthe user shall be compulsorily required to change the password,  on the first login.    \n54. When the internet banking application is accessed through external websites ( eg: \nin case of payment of taxes,  e-commerce transactions , etc.), the procedure f or \nauthentication and the appearance/ look and feel  of the RE’s internet banki ng site \nshould be made uniform as far as possible.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 16 \n Chapter IV  \nMOBILE PAYMENTS APPLICATION SECURITY CONTROLS   \nIn addition to the controls prescribed in Chapter II, the following instructions are \napplicable to the REs offering/ intending to offer mobile banking / mobile payments  \nfacility to their customers  through mobile application:  \n55. On detection of any anomalies or exceptions for which the mobile application was \nnot programmed, the customer shall  be directed to remove the current copy/ \ninstance of the application and proceed with installation of a new copy/ instance of \nthe application.  REs shall be able to verify the version of the mobile application \nbefore the transactions are enabled.   \n56. Specific Controls for mobile  applications include:  \na) Device policy enforcement (allowing app install ation / execution after baseline \nrequirements are met);  \nb) Application secure download/ install;  \nc) Deactivating older application versions in a phased but time bound manner (not \nexceeding six months from the date of release of newer version) i.e., \nmaintaining only one version (excluding the overlap period while phasing out \nolder version) of the mobile application on a platform/ operating system;  \nd) Storage of customer data;  \ne) Device or application encryption;  \nf) Ensuring minimal data collection/ app permissions;  \ng) Application sandbox/  containerisation;   \nh) Ability to identify remote access applications (to the extent possible) and prohibit login access to the mobile application, as a matter of precaution; and   \ni) Code obfuscation.  \n \n57. REs may consider to perform validation on the security and compatibility condition \nof the device/ operating system and the mobile application  to ensure that activities \nrelating to the account  are put through the mobile application in a safe and secure \nmanner.   \n58. REs may explore the feasibility of implementing a code that checks if the device is \nrooted/ jailbroken prior to the installation of the mobile application and disallow the \nmobile application to install/  function if the phone is rooted/ jailbroken.  \n59. Checksum of current  active  version of application  shall be hosted on public platform \nso that users can verify the same.  \n ""]"
