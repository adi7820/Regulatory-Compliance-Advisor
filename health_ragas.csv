1,How will the assessment of clinical trial applications be carried out under the new regulation?,"The assessment of clinical trial applications will be carried out by the concerned Member States in a coordinated manner, using a single assessment model that includes both national and international coordination and evaluation of safety reports and results of inspections.",,"['I \n(Legislativ e acts) \nREGUL ATIONS \nREGUL ATION (EU) No 536/2014 OF THE EUR OPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL \nof 16 Apr il 2014 \non clinical trials on medicinal products for human use, and repealing Directiv e 2001/20/EC \n(Text with EEA relevance) \nTHE EUR OPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUR OPEAN UNION, \nHaving regar d to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 114 and 168(4)(c) \nthereof, \nHaving regar d to the proposal from the European Commission, \nAfter transmission of the draf t legislative act to the national parliaments, \nHaving regar d to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committ ee (1), \nAfter consulting the Committ ee of the Regions, \nActing in accordance with the ordinar y legislative procedure (2), \nWhereas: \n(1)  In a clinical trial the rights, safety , dignity and well-being of subjects should be protect ed and the data generat ed \nshould be reliable and robust. The inter ests of the subjects should alwa ys take priority over all other interests. \n(2)  In order to allow for independent control as to whether these principles are adhered to, a clinical trial should be \nsubject to prior author isation. \n(3)  The existing definition of a clinical trial as contained in Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and of \nthe Council (3) should be clarified. For that purpose, the concept of clinical trial should be more precisely defined \nby introducing the broader concept of ‘clinical study’ of which the clinical trial is a catego ry. That catego ry \nshould be defined on the basis of specific criteria. This approach takes due account of intern ational guidelines, \nand is in line with the Union law governing medicinal products, whic h builds on the dichotom y of ‘clinical trial’ \nand ‘non-int erventional study’ . \n(4)  Directive 2001/20/EC aims to simplify and harmonise the administrative provisions governing clinical trials in \nthe Union. However , exper ience shows that a harmonised approach to the regulation of clinical trials has only \nbeen partly achieved. This make s it in particular difficult to perform a given clinical trial in several Member 27.5.2014 L 158/1 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     \n(1)OJ C 44, 15.2.2013, p. 99. \n(2)Position of the European Parliament of 3 Apr il 2014 (not yet published in the Official Jour nal) and decision of the Council of 14 Apr il \n2014. \n(3)Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 Apr il 2001 on the appro ximation of the laws, regulations and \nadministrative provisions of the Member States relating to the implementation of good clinical practice in the conduct of clinical trials on \nmedicinal products for human use (OJ L 121, 1.5.2001, p. 34). States. Scientific development, however , sugges ts that future clinical trials will target more specifi c patient popula \xad\ntions, such as subgroups identif ied through genomic information. In order to include a suffi cient number of \npatients for such clinical trials it may be necessar y to involve many , or all, Member State s. The new procedures \nfor the author isation of clinical trials should stimulate the inclusion of as man y Member States as possible. There \xad\nfore, in order to simplify the procedures for the submission of an application dossier for the author isation of a \nclinical trial, the multiple submission of largely identical information should be avoided and replaced by the \nsubmission of one application dossier to all the Member States concer ned through a sing le submission portal. \nGiven that clinical trials carried out in a sing le Member State are equally impor tant to European clinical research, \nthe application dossier for such clinical trials should also be submitte d through that sing le portal. \n(5)  As regar ds Directive 2001/20/EC, exper ience also indicates that the legal form of a Regulation would present \nadvantag es for sponsors and investigat ors, for example in the context of clinical trials taking place in more than \none Member State, since they will be able to rely on its provisions directly , but also in the cont ext of safety \nrepor ting and labelling of investig ational medicinal products. Divergences of approach among diffe rent Member \nStates will be theref ore kept to a minimum. \n(6) The Member State s concer ned should cooperate in assessing a request for author isation of a clinical trial. This co\xad\noperation should not include aspects of an intrinsically national nature, such as informed consent. \n(7)  In order to avoid administrative dela ys for starting a clinical trial, the procedure to be used should be flexible and \nefficient, without compromising patient safety or public health. \n(8)  The timelines for assessing an application dossier for clinical trials should be sufficient to assess the file while, at \nthe same time, ensur ing quic k access to new , inno vative treatments and ensur ing that the Union remains an \nattractive place for conducting clinical trials. Agai nst this back ground, Directive 2001/20/EC introduced the \nconcep t of tacit author isation. This concep t should be maintained in order to ensure that timelines are adhered \nto. In the event of a public health crisis, Member States should have the possibility to assess and author ise a clin\xad\nical trial application swif tly. No minimal timelines for appro val should theref ore be established. \n(9)  Clinical trials for the development of orphan medicinal products as defined in Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 of \nthe European Parliament and of the Council (1) and of medicinal products addressed to subjects affect ed by \nsevere, debilitating and often life-thr eatening diseases affect ing no more than one person in 50 000 in the Union \n(ultra-rare diseases) should be foste red. \n(10)  Member States should efficiently assess all clinical trials applications within the given timelines. A rapid yet in- \ndepth assessment is of particular impor tance for clinical trials concer ning medical conditions which are severely \ndebilitating and/or life threatening and for whic h therapeutic options are limited or non-exist ent, as in the case of \nrare and ultra-rare diseases. \n(11)  The risk to subject safety in a clinical trial mainly stem s from two sources: the investig ational medicinal product \nand the inter vention. Many clinical trials, however , pose only a minimal additional risk to subject safety compared \nto normal clinical practice. This is particularly the case where the investig ational medicinal product is covered by \na mark eting author isation, that is the quality , safety and efficacy has already been assessed in the course of the \nmark eting author isation procedure"" or, if that product is not used in accordance with the term s of the marketing \nauthor isation, that use is evidence- based and suppor ted by published scientific evidence on the safety and effi\xad\ncacy of that product, and the inter vention poses only very limited additional risk to the subject compared to \nnormal clinical practice. Those low-inte rvention clinical trials are often of crucial impor tance for assessing stand \xad\nard treatments and diagnoses, thereby optimising the use of medicinal products and thus contr ibuting to a high \nlevel of public health. Those clinical trials should be subject to less stringent rules, as regards monitori ng, require \xad\nments for the cont ents of the mast er file and traceability of investigat ional medicinal products. In order to ensure \nsubject safety they should however be subject to the same application procedure as any other clinical trial. The \npublished scientific evidence suppor ting the safety and efficacy of an inve stigational medicinal product not used \nin accordance with the term s of the mark eting author isation could include high quality data published in scien \xad\ntific jour nal articles, as well as national, regional or institutional treatment protocols, health technology assess \xad\nment repor ts or other appropr iate evidence. 27.5.2014 L 158/2 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     \n(1)Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 1999 on orphan medicinal products \n(OJ L 18, 22.1.2000, p. 1).

8,What is the requirement for traceability of investigational medicinal products in clinical trials under the new regulation?,"The regulation requires that investigational medicinal products used in clinical trials are traceable throughout the trial, using a specific labelling system and tracking documents to ensure the authenticity of the products and the correct investigation protocol is followed.",,"['I \n(Legislativ e acts) \nREGUL ATIONS \nREGUL ATION (EU) No 536/2014 OF THE EUR OPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL \nof 16 Apr il 2014 \non clinical trials on medicinal products for human use, and repealing Directiv e 2001/20/EC \n(Text with EEA relevance) \nTHE EUR OPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUR OPEAN UNION, \nHaving regar d to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 114 and 168(4)(c) \nthereof, \nHaving regar d to the proposal from the European Commission, \nAfter transmission of the draf t legislative act to the national parliaments, \nHaving regar d to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committ ee (1), \nAfter consulting the Committ ee of the Regions, \nActing in accordance with the ordinar y legislative procedure (2), \nWhereas: \n(1)  In a clinical trial the rights, safety , dignity and well-being of subjects should be protect ed and the data generat ed \nshould be reliable and robust. The inter ests of the subjects should alwa ys take priority over all other interests. \n(2)  In order to allow for independent control as to whether these principles are adhered to, a clinical trial should be \nsubject to prior author isation. \n(3)  The existing definition of a clinical trial as contained in Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and of \nthe Council (3) should be clarified. For that purpose, the concept of clinical trial should be more precisely defined \nby introducing the broader concept of ‘clinical study’ of which the clinical trial is a catego ry. That catego ry \nshould be defined on the basis of specific criteria. This approach takes due account of intern ational guidelines, \nand is in line with the Union law governing medicinal products, whic h builds on the dichotom y of ‘clinical trial’ \nand ‘non-int erventional study’ . \n(4)  Directive 2001/20/EC aims to simplify and harmonise the administrative provisions governing clinical trials in \nthe Union. However , exper ience shows that a harmonised approach to the regulation of clinical trials has only \nbeen partly achieved. This make s it in particular difficult to perform a given clinical trial in several Member 27.5.2014 L 158/1 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     \n(1)OJ C 44, 15.2.2013, p. 99. \n(2)Position of the European Parliament of 3 Apr il 2014 (not yet published in the Official Jour nal) and decision of the Council of 14 Apr il \n2014. \n(3)Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 Apr il 2001 on the appro ximation of the laws, regulations and \nadministrative provisions of the Member States relating to the implementation of good clinical practice in the conduct of clinical trials on \nmedicinal products for human use (OJ L 121, 1.5.2001, p. 34). States. Scientific development, however , sugges ts that future clinical trials will target more specifi c patient popula \xad\ntions, such as subgroups identif ied through genomic information. In order to include a suffi cient number of \npatients for such clinical trials it may be necessar y to involve many , or all, Member State s. The new procedures \nfor the author isation of clinical trials should stimulate the inclusion of as man y Member States as possible. There \xad\nfore, in order to simplify the procedures for the submission of an application dossier for the author isation of a \nclinical trial, the multiple submission of largely identical information should be avoided and replaced by the \nsubmission of one application dossier to all the Member States concer ned through a sing le submission portal. \nGiven that clinical trials carried out in a sing le Member State are equally impor tant to European clinical research, \nthe application dossier for such clinical trials should also be submitte d through that sing le portal. \n(5)  As regar ds Directive 2001/20/EC, exper ience also indicates that the legal form of a Regulation would present \nadvantag es for sponsors and investigat ors, for example in the context of clinical trials taking place in more than \none Member State, since they will be able to rely on its provisions directly , but also in the cont ext of safety \nrepor ting and labelling of investig ational medicinal products. Divergences of approach among diffe rent Member \nStates will be theref ore kept to a minimum. \n(6) The Member State s concer ned should cooperate in assessing a request for author isation of a clinical trial. This co\xad\noperation should not include aspects of an intrinsically national nature, such as informed consent. \n(7)  In order to avoid administrative dela ys for starting a clinical trial, the procedure to be used should be flexible and \nefficient, without compromising patient safety or public health. \n(8)  The timelines for assessing an application dossier for clinical trials should be sufficient to assess the file while, at \nthe same time, ensur ing quic k access to new , inno vative treatments and ensur ing that the Union remains an \nattractive place for conducting clinical trials. Agai nst this back ground, Directive 2001/20/EC introduced the \nconcep t of tacit author isation. This concep t should be maintained in order to ensure that timelines are adhered \nto. In the event of a public health crisis, Member States should have the possibility to assess and author ise a clin\xad\nical trial application swif tly. No minimal timelines for appro val should theref ore be established. \n(9)  Clinical trials for the development of orphan medicinal products as defined in Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 of \nthe European Parliament and of the Council (1) and of medicinal products addressed to subjects affect ed by \nsevere, debilitating and often life-thr eatening diseases affect ing no more than one person in 50 000 in the Union \n(ultra-rare diseases) should be foste red. \n(10)  Member States should efficiently assess all clinical trials applications within the given timelines. A rapid yet in- \ndepth assessment is of particular impor tance for clinical trials concer ning medical conditions which are severely \ndebilitating and/or life threatening and for whic h therapeutic options are limited or non-exist ent, as in the case of \nrare and ultra-rare diseases. \n(11)  The risk to subject safety in a clinical trial mainly stem s from two sources: the investig ational medicinal product \nand the inter vention. Many clinical trials, however , pose only a minimal additional risk to subject safety compared \nto normal clinical practice. This is particularly the case where the investig ational medicinal product is covered by \na mark eting author isation, that is the quality , safety and efficacy has already been assessed in the course of the \nmark eting author isation procedure"" or, if that product is not used in accordance with the term s of the marketing \nauthor isation, that use is evidence- based and suppor ted by published scientific evidence on the safety and effi\xad\ncacy of that product, and the inter vention poses only very limited additional risk to the subject compared to \nnormal clinical practice. Those low-inte rvention clinical trials are often of crucial impor tance for assessing stand \xad\nard treatments and diagnoses, thereby optimising the use of medicinal products and thus contr ibuting to a high \nlevel of public health. Those clinical trials should be subject to less stringent rules, as regards monitori ng, require \xad\nments for the cont ents of the mast er file and traceability of investigat ional medicinal products. In order to ensure \nsubject safety they should however be subject to the same application procedure as any other clinical trial. The \npublished scientific evidence suppor ting the safety and efficacy of an inve stigational medicinal product not used \nin accordance with the term s of the mark eting author isation could include high quality data published in scien \xad\ntific jour nal articles, as well as national, regional or institutional treatment protocols, health technology assess \xad\nment repor ts or other appropr iate evidence. 27.5.2014 L 158/2 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     \n(1)Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 1999 on orphan medicinal products \n(OJ L 18, 22.1.2000, p. 1).

REPORTING OF SUSPECTED UNEXPECTED SERIOUS ADVERSE REA CTIONS (SUSARS) BY THE SPONSOR TO THE AGENCY \nIN ACCORD ANCE WITH ARTICL E 42 \n2.1.  Adverse Events and Causality \n2.  Medication errors, pregnancies and uses outside what is foreseen in the protocol, including misuse and abuse \nof the product, shall be subject to the same oblig ation to repor t as adverse reactions. \n3.  In deter mining whether an adverse event is an adverse reaction, consideration shall be given to whether there \nis a reasonable possibility of establishing a causal relationship between the event and the inve stigational medi \xad\ncinal product based on an analysis of available evidence. \n4.  In the absence of information on causality provided by the repor ting investig ator , the sponsor shall consult the \nrepor ting investig ator and encourage him to express an opinion on this issue. The causality assessment given \nby the inve stigat or shall not be downgraded by the sponsor . If the sponsor disagrees with the investigat or's \ncausality assessment, the opinion of both the investigat or and the sponsor shall be provided with the repor t. \n2.2.  Expectedness, unexpectedness and the RSI \n5.  In deter mining whether an adverse event is unexpected , consideration shall be given to whether the event adds \nsignificant information on the specificity , increase of occur rence, or sever ity of a kno wn, already documented \nserious adverse reaction. \n6. The expecte dness of an adverse reaction shall be set out by the sponsor in the RSI. Expect edness shall be deter\xad\nmined on the basis of events previously obser ved with the active substance and not on the basis of the antici \xad\npated phar macological proper ties of a medicinal product or events related to the subject's disease. \n7.  The RSI shall be contained in the SmPC or the IB. The covering letter shall refer to the location of the RSI in \nthe application dossier . If the inve stigational medicinal product is author ised in several Member States \nconcer ned with different SmPCs, the sponsor shall select the most appropr iate SmPC, with reference to subject \nsafet y, as the RSI. \n8.  The RSI may change during the conduct of a clinical trial. For the purpose of repor ting SUSA Rs the version of \nthe RSI at the moment of occur rence of the SUSA R shall apply . Thus, a change of the RSI impacts on the \nnumber of adverse reactions to be repor ted as SUSARs. Regarding the applicable RSI for the purpose of the \nannual safety repor t, see section 3 of this Annex. \n9. If information on expectedne ss has been provided by the repor ting investigat or, this shall be taken into consid \xad\neration by the sponsor . \n2.3.  Information for the repor ting of SUSARs \n10.  The information shall at least include: \n(a)  a valid EU trial number ; \n(b)  a sponsor study number; \n(c)  an identif iable coded subject ; \n(d)  an identif iable repor ter; \n(e)  a SUSA R; \n(f)  a suspect investigat ional medicinal product (including active substance name-code); \n(g)  a causality assessment. 27.5.2014 L 158/66 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     11.  In addition, in order to properly process the repor t electronically , the following administrative information \nshall be provided: \n(a)  the sender's (case) safety repor t unique identifier ; \n(b)  the receive date of the initial information from the primar y source; \n(c)  the receipt date of the most recent information; \n(d)  the worldwide unique case identification number ; \n(e)  the sender identif ier. \n2.4.  Follo w-up repor ts of SUSARs \n12.  If the initial repor t of a SUSA R refer red to in point (a) of Article 42(2) (fata l or life-thr eatening ) is incomple te, \nfor example if the sponsor has not provided all the information within seven days, the sponsor shall submit a \ncompl eted repor t based on the initial information within an additional eight days. \n13.  The clock for initial repor ting (day 0 = Di 0) starts as soon as the information containing the minimum \nrepor ting criteria has been received by the sponsor . \n14.  If signif icant new information on an already repor ted case is received by the sponsor , the clock starts again at \nday zero, that is the date of receip t of the new information. This information shall be repor ted as a follow-up \nrepor t within 15 days. \n15.  If the initial repor t of a SUSA R referred to in Article 42(2)(c) (initially considered to be non-fat al or non-life- \nthreate ning but whic h turns out to be fatal or life-thr eatening) is incomplet e, a follow-up repor t shall be made \nas soon as possible, but within a maximum of seven days of first kno wledge of the reaction being fatal or life- \nthreate ning. The sponsor shall submit a compl eted repor t within an additional eight days. \n16.  In cases where a SUSA R turns out to be fatal or life-thr eatening, whereas initially it was considered as non-fat al \nor not life-th reatening, if the initial repor t has not yet been submitted, a combined repor t shall be creat ed. \n2.5.  Unblinding treatment allocation \n17.  The investigat or shall only unblind the treatment allocation of a subject in the course of a clinical trial if \nunblinding is relevant to the safet y of the subject. \n18.  When repor ting a SUSAR to the Agen cy, the sponsor shall only unblind the treatment allocation of the affect ed \nsubject to whom the SUSAR relates. \n19.  If an event is poten tially a SUSAR the blind shall be brok en for that subject only by the sponsor . The blind \nshall be maintained for other persons responsible for the ongoing conduct of the clinical trial (suc h as the \nmanag ement, monitor s, investigat ors) and those persons responsible for data analysis and interpretat ion of \nresults at the conclusion of the clinical trial, such as biometr ics personnel. \n20.  Unblinded information shall be accessible only to persons who need to be involved in the safety repor ting to \nthe Agen cy, to Data Safety Monitoring Boards ('DSMB'), or to persons performin g ongoing safet y evaluations \nduring the clinical trial. \n21.  However , for clinial trials carried out in high morbidity or high mor tality disease, where efficacy end-points \ncould also be SUSARs or when mor tality or another 'serious' outcome, that may poten tially be repor ted as a \nSUSA R, is the efficacy end-point in a clinical trial, the integr ity of the clinical trial may be compromised if the \nblind is systematically broke n. Under these and similar circumstances, the sponsor shall highlight in the \nprot ocol which serious events are to be treated as disease-relate d and are not subject to systematic unblinding \nand expedited repor ting. \n22.  If following unblinding, an event turns out to be a SUSA R the repor ting rules for SUSA Rs set out in Article 42 \nand in Section 2 of this Annex shall apply . \n3.

17,What is the requirement for the assessment of applications for the authorization of clinical trials?,"The assessment of applications for the authorization of clinical trials should be conducted on the basis of appropriate expertise, and specific expertise should be considered when assessing clinical trials involving subjects in emergency situations, minors, incapacitated subjects, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and other identified specific population groups.",,"[""(12)  The Recommendation of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Council on the \nGovernance of Clinical Trials of 10 December 2012 introduced different risk categor ies for clinical trials. Those \ncatego ries are compati ble with the cate gories of clinical trials defined in this Regulation as the OECD Categor ies A \nand B(1) correspond to the definition of a low-inter vention clinical trial as set out in this Regulation, and the \nOECD Categor ies B(2) and C correspond to the definition of a clinical trial as set out in this Regulation. \n(13)  The assessment of the application for a clinical trial should address in particular the anticipated therapeutic and \npublic health benefits (relevance) and the risk and inconvenience for the subject. In respect of the relevance, \nvarious aspects should be taken into account, including whether the clinical trial has been recommended or \nimposed by regulatory author ities in charg e of the assessment of medicinal products and the author isation of \ntheir placing on the market and whether surrogate end-points, when they are used, are justif ied. \n(14) Unless other wise justified in the prot ocol, the subjects participating in a clinical trial should represent the popula \xad\ntion groups, for example gender and age groups, that are likely to use the medicinal product investig ated in the \nclinical trial. \n(15)  In order to improve treatments available for vulnerable groups such as frail or older people, people suffer ing \nfrom multiple chronic conditions, and people affected by mental health disorders, medicinal products whic h are \nlikely to be of significant clinical value should be fully and appropr iately studied for their effects in these specifi c \ngroups, including as regards requirements related to their specific charact eristics and the prote ction of the health \nand well-being of subjects belonging to these groups. \n(16)  The author isation procedure should provide for the possibility to extend the timelines for the assessment in order \nto allow the sponsor to address questions or comments raised during the assessment of the application dossier . \nMoreo ver, it should be ensured that, within the exte nsion period, there is alwa ys suffi cient time for assessing the \nadditional information submitted. \n(17)  The author isation to conduct a clinical trial should address all aspects of subject prot ection and data reliability \nand robustness. That author isation should theref ore be contained in a sing le administrative decision by the \nMember State concer ned. \n(18)  It should be left to the Member State concer ned to deter mine the appropr iate body or bodies to be involved in \nthe assessment of the application to conduct a clinical trial and to organise the involvement of ethics committees \nwithin the timelines for the author isation of that clinical trial as set out in this Regulation. Such decisions are a \nmatt er of internal organisation for each Member State . When deter mining the appropr iate body or bodies, \nMember States should ensure the involvement of laypersons, in particular patients or patients' organisations. \nThey should also ensure that the necessar y exper tise is available. In accordance with international guidelines, the \nassessment should be done jointly by a reasonable number of persons who collectively have the necessar y qualifi \xad\ncations and exper ience. The persons assessing the application should be independent of the sponsor , the clinical \ntrial site, and the investiga tors involved, as well as free from any other undue influence. \n(19) The assessment of applications for the author isation of clinical trials should be conduct ed on the basis of appro \xad\npriate exper tise. Specific exper tise should be considered when assessing clinical trials involving subjects in emer \xad\ngency situations, minors, incapacitated subjects, pregnant and breastf eeding women and, where appropr iate, other \nidentified specifi c population groups, such as elderly people or people suffering from rare and ultra rare diseases. \n(20)  In practice, sponsors do not alwa ys have all the information needed for submitting a compl ete application for \nauthor isation of a clinical trial in all of the Member States where a clinical trial is eventually going to be \nconduct ed. It should be possible for sponsors to submit an application solely on the basis of documents assessed \njointly by those Member State s where the clinical trial might be conducted. \n(21) The sponsor should be allowed to withdraw the application for author isation of a clinical trial. To ensure the reli\xad\nable functioning of the assessment procedure, however , an application for author isation of a clinical trial should \nbe withdra wn only for the entire clinical trial. It should be possible for the sponsor to submit a new application \nfor author isation of a clinical trial following the withdrawal of an application. 27.5.2014 L 158/3 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     (22)  In practice, in order to reac h recr uitment targets or for other reasons, sponsors may have an interest in extending \nthe clinical trial to an additional Member States after the initial author isation of the clinical trial. An author isation \nmech anism should be provided to allow for such extensi on, while avoiding the re-assessment of the application \nby all the Member States concer ned whic h were involved in the initial author isation of the clinical trial. \n(23)  Clinical trials are usually subject to man y modifi cations after they have been author ised. Those modifi cations may \nrelat e to the conduct, the design, the methodology , the investig ational or auxiliar y medicinal product, or the \ninvestigat or or clinical trial site involved. Where those modifi cations have a substantial impact on the safety or \nrights of the subjects or on the reliability and robustness of the data generate d in the clinical trial, they should be \nsubject to an author isation procedure similar to the initial author isation procedure. \n(24)  The cont ent of the application dossier for author isation of a clinical trial should be harmonised in order to \nensure that all Member States have the same information available and to simplify the application process for \nclinical trials. \n(25)  In order to increase transparency in the area of clinical trials, data from a clinical trial should only be submitted \nin suppor t of a clinical trial application if that clinical trial has been recorded in a publicly accessible and free of \ncharge database which is a primar y or partner registr y of, or a data provider to, the international clinical trials \nregistr y platf orm of the World Health Org anization (WHO ICTRP). Data providers to the WHO ICTRP create and \nmanag e clinical trial records in a manner that is consist ent with the WHO registr y criteria. Specifi c provision \nshould be made for data from clinical trials started before the date of application of this Regulation. \n(26)  It should be left to Member States to establish the language requirements for the application dossier . To ensure \nthat the assessment of the application for author isation of a clinical trial functions smoothly , Member States \nshould consider accep ting a commonly underst ood language in the medical field as the language for the docu \xad\nmentation not destined for the subject. \n(27)  Human dignity and the right to the integrit y of the person are recognised in the Char ter of Fundamental Rights \nof the European Union (the ‘Char ter’). In particular , the Char ter requires that any inter vention in the field of \nbiology and medicine cannot be performed without free and informed consent of the person concer ned. Directive \n2001/20/EC contains an exte nsive set of rules for the prot ection of subjects. These rules should be upheld. \nRegarding the rules concer ning the determination of the legally designate d representatives of incapacitated \npersons and minors, those rules diverge in Member States. It should theref ore be left to Member State s to deter\xad\nmine the legally designate d representatives of incapacitated persons and minors. Incapacitated subjects, minors, \npregnant women and breastf eeding women require specific protection measures. \n(28) An appropr iately qualified medical doctor or, where appropr iate, a qualifi ed dental practitioner should be respon \xad\nsible for all medical care provided to the subject, including the medical care provided by other medical staff. \n(29) It is appropr iate that universities and other researc h institutions, under certain circumstances that are in accord \xad\nance with the applicable law on data prot ection, be able to collect data from clinical trials to be used for future \nscientific researc h, for example for medical, natural or social sciences researc h purposes. In order to collect data \nfor such purposes it is necessar y that the subject gives consent to use his or her data outside the protocol of the \nclinical trial and has the right to withdraw that consent at any time. It is also necessar y that research projects \nbased on such data be made subject to reviews that are appropr iate for researc h on human data, for example on \nethical aspects, before being conducted. \n(30)  In accordance with international guidelines, the informed consent of a subject should be in writing. When the \nsubject is unable to write, it may be recorded through appropr iate alternati ve means, for instance through audio \nor video recorders. Prior to obtaining informed consent, the poten tial subject should receive information in a \nprior inter view in a language whic h is easily underst ood by him or her. The subject should have the oppor tunity \nto ask questions at any moment. Adequate time should be provided for the subject to consider his or her deci \xad\nsion. In view of the fact that in certain Member States the only person qualified under national law to perf orm an \ninter view with a poten tial subject is a medical doctor while in other Member States this is done by other profes \xad\nsionals, it is appropr iate to provide that the prior interview with a poten tial subject should be performe d by a \nmember of the inve stigating team qualified for this task under the national law of the Member State where the \nrecr uitment takes place. 27.5.2014 L 158/4 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     ""]"

19,Who are in a situation of subordination or factual dependency and may require specific protective measures in clinical trials?,"Persons performing mandatory military service, persons deprived of liberty, persons who, due to a judicial decision, cannot take part in clinical trials, and persons, who due to their age, disability or state of health are reliant on care and for that reason accommodated in residential care institutions.",,"[""(31)  In order to certify that informed consent is given freely , the investig ator should take into account all relevant \ncircumstances which might influence the decision of a poten tial subject to participate in a clinical trial, in particu\xad\nlar whether the poten tial subject belongs to an economically or socially disadvantaged group or is in a situation \nof institutional or hierarc hical dependency that could inappropr iately influence her or his decision to participate. \n(32)  This Regulation should be without prejudice to national law requir ing that, in addition to the informed consent \ngiven by the legally designat ed representative, a minor who is capable of forming an opinion and assessing the \ninformation given to him or her, should himself or herself assent in order to participat e in a clinical trial. \n(33)  It is appropr iate to allow that informed consent be obtained by simplified means for certain clinical trials where \nthe methodology of the trial requires that groups of subjects rather than individual subjects are allocat ed to \nreceive differ ent investigational medicinal products. In those clinical trials the investig ational medicinal products \nare used in accordance with the mark eting author isations, and the individual subject receives a standard treatment \nregar dless of whether he or she accepts or refuses to participat e in the clinical trial, or withdraws from it, so that \nthe only consequence of non-par ticipation is that data relating to him or her are not used for the clinical trial. \nSuch clinical trials, whic h serve to compare established treatments, should alwa ys be conduct ed within a sing le \nMember State. \n(34)  Specific provisions should be defined for the protection of pregnant and breastf eeding women participating in \nclinical trials and in particular when the clinical trial does not have the poten tial to produce results of direct \nbenefit to her or to her embr yo, foetus or child after birth. \n(35) Persons performi ng mandatory militar y service, persons depr ived of liber ty, persons who, due to a judicial deci \xad\nsion, cannot take part in clinical trials, and persons, who due to their age, disability or state of health are reliant \non care and for that reason accommodated in residential care institutions, that is accommodations providing an \nunint errupted assistance for persons who necessitate such assistance, are in a situation of subordination or factual \ndependency and theref ore may require specific prot ective measures. Member State s should be allowed to maintain \nsuch additional measures. \n(36) This Regulation should provide for clear rules concer ning informed consent in emergency situations. Such situ\xad\nations relate to cases where for example a patient has suffered a sudden life-th reatening medical condition due to \nmultiple traumas, strokes or hear t attacks, necessitating immediate medical inter vention. For such cases, inter ven\xad\ntion within an ongoing clinical trial, which has already been appro ved, may be pertinent. However , in certain \nemerg ency situations, it is not possible to obtain informed consent prior to the inter vention. This Regulation \nshould theref ore set clear rules whereby such patients may be enrolled in the clinical trial under very strict condi \xad\ntions. In addition, the said clinical trial should relat e directly to the medical condition because of whic h it is not \npossible within the therapeutic windo w to obtain prior informed consent from the subject or from his or her \nlegally designated representative. Any previously expressed objection by the patient should be respecte d, and \ninformed consent from the subject or from his or her legally designat ed representative should be sought as soon \nas possible. \n(37) In order to allow patients to assess possibilities to participate in a clinical trial, and to allow for effective super vi\xad\nsion of a clinical trial by the Member State concer ned, the start of the clinical trial, the end of the recr uitment of \nsubjects for the clinical trial and the end of the clinical trial should be notified. In accordance with international \nstandards, the results of the clinical trial should be repor ted within one year from the end of the clinical trial. \n(38)  The date of the first act of recr uitment of a potential subject is the date on which the first act of the recr uitment \nstrateg y descr ibed in the protocol was performe d, e. g. the date of a contact with a poten tial subject or the date \nof the publication of an adver tisement for a particular clinical trial. \n(39) The sponsor should submit a summar y of the results of the clinical trial together with a summar y that is under \xad\nstandable to a layperson, and the clinical study repor t, where applicable, within the defined timelines. Where it is \nnot possible to submit the summar y of the results within the defined timelines for scientifi c reasons, for example \nwhen the clinical trial is still ongoing in third countr ies and data from that part of the trial are not available, \nwhic h makes a statistical analysis not relevant, the sponsor should justify this in the prot ocol and specify when \nthe results are going to be submitte d. 27.5.2014 L 158/5 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     (40)  In order for the sponsor to assess all poten tially relevant safety information, the inve stigat or should, as a rule, \nrepor t to him all serious adverse events. \n(41)  The sponsor should assess the information received from the investig ator , and repor t safet y information on \nserious adverse events which are suspect ed unexpected serious adverse reactions to the European Medicines \nAgen cy (‘the Agen cy’). \n(42)  The Agency should forward that information to the Member States for them to assess it. \n(43)  The members of the Internati onal Conf erence on Harmonisation of Techn ical Requirements for Registration of \nPhar maceuticals for Human Use (ICH) have agreed on a detailed set of guidelines on good clinical practice which \nis an internationally accept ed standard for designing, conducting, recording and repor ting clinical trials, consist ent \nwith principles that have their origin in the World Medical Association's Declaration of Helsinki. When designing, \nconducting, recording and repor ting clinical trials, detailed questions may arise as to the appropr iate quality \nstandard. In such a case, the ICH guidelines on good clinical practice should be taken appropr iately into account \nfor the application of the rules set out in this Regulation, provided that there is no other specific guidance issued \nby the Commission and that those guidelines are compati ble with this Regulation. \n(44)  The conduct of a clinical trial should be adequate ly monitored by the sponsor in order to ensure the reliability \nand robustness of the results. Monitor ing may also contr ibut e to subject safety , taking into account the charact er\xad\nistics of the clinical trial and respect for fundamental rights of subjects. When establishing the extent of moni \xad\ntoring, the character istics of the clinical trial should be taken into account. \n(45) The individuals involved in conducting a clinical trial, in particular investig ators and other healthcare profes \xad\nsionals, should be sufficiently qualifi ed to perform their tasks, and the facilities where a clinical trial is to be \nconduct ed should be suitable for that clinical trial. \n(46)  In order to ensure subject safety and the reliability and robustness of data from clinical trials, it is appropr iate to \nprovide that there should be arrang ements for traceability , storag e, retur n and destr uction of inve stigational medi \xad\ncinal products, depending on the nature of the clinical trial. For the same reasons, there should also be such \narrang ements for unauthor ised auxiliar y medicinal products. \n(47) Dur ing a clinical trial, a sponsor may become awar e of serious breac hes of the rules for the conduct of that clin\xad\nical trial. This should be repor ted to the Member State s concer ned in order for action to be taken by those \nMember States, where necessar y. \n(48)  Apar t from the repor ting of suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, there may be other events which are \nrelevant in term s of benefi t-risk balance and whic h should be repor ted in a timely manner to the Member States \nconcer ned. It is impor tant for subject safet y that, in addition to serious adverse events and reactions, all unex \xad\npecte d events that might mate rially influence the benefit-r isk assessment of the medicinal product or that would \nlead to chang es in the administration of a medicinal product or in overall conduct of a clinical trial are notified \nto the Member States concer ned. Examples of such unexpected events include an increase in the rate of occur \xad\nrence of expected serious adverse reactions which may be clinically important, a signif icant hazard to the patient \npopulation, such as lack of efficacy of a medicinal product, or a major safety finding from a newly complet ed \nanimal study (suc h as carcinog enicity). \n(49)  Where unexpected events require an urgent modification of a clinical trial, it should be possible for the sponsor \nand the investigat or to take urgent safety measures without awaiting prior author isation. If such measures consti \xad\ntute a temporar y halt of the clinical trial, the sponsor should apply for a substantial modifi cation before restar ting \nthe clinical trial. \n(50)  In order to ensure compl iance of the conduct of a clinical trial with the prot ocol, and in order for investigat ors \nto be informed about the inve stigational medicinal products they administe r, the sponsor should supply the inves \xad\ntigat ors with an inve stigat or's broch ure. 27.5.2014 L 158/6 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     ""]"

Integral Drug -Device Combinations  \n2.1.  When is my medical device considered to form an integral product with a medicinal \nproduct?  Rev. May 2024  \nThere are two types of iDDCs8 according to MDR Articles 1(8) and 1(9) (see also Question 1.1).  \n1. A medical device that incorporates, as an integral part, a substance which, if used separately, would \nbe considered a medicinal product and where the action of that substance is principal, the integral \nproduct will be regulated as a medicinal product (seco nd subparagraph of Article 1(8)). Examples \ninclude an ingestible sensor that is incorporated  into a medicinal product.  \n2. If a medical device used to administer a medicinal product is  placed on the market in such a way \nthat the  two constituents parts (the medical device and medicinal product)  form a single integral \nproduct which is intended exclusively for use in the given combination and which is not reusable, \nthat single integral product shall be governed by Directive 2001/83/EC or Regulation (EC) No \n726/2004, as applicable. The second paragraph  of Article 1(9) of the MDR sets out three cumulative \nconditions that need to be satisfied at the moment of placing on the market:  \ni. the device and the medicinal product form a single integral product  when placed on the market , \nii. the single integral product is intended exclusively for use in the given combination , \niii. the single integral product is not reusable.  \nBelow are provided some examples.  \nFor medicinal products meeting either one or both of the above definitions , the integral product shall \nbe governed by Directive 2001/83/EC or Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, as applicable . However, the \nrelevant general safety and performance requirements set out in Annex I to Regulation  (EU) 2017/745 \nshall apply as far as the safety and performance of the device part of the integral product is concerned.  \n \n8 so-called ‘integral medicinal products’ in the EMA Guideline on quality documentation for medicinal products when used \nwith a medical device  (EMA/CHMP/QWP/BWP/259165/2019)   \nQuestions & Answers for applicants, marketing authorisation holders of medicinal \nproducts and notified bodies with respect to the implementation of the Regulations on \nmedical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices (Regulations (EU) 2017/745 \nand (E    \nEMA/37991/2019 Rev.4 Page 8/23 \n Examples of integral products which are not reusable are pre -filled syringes, pre -filled pens, nebuli sers \npre-charged with a specific medicinal product, nasal and oromucosal sprays, patches for transdermal \ndrug delivery , pre-filled inhalers  and co-packaged pre-filled syringe with solvent  (e.g. water for \ninjections)  used for administration of the reconstituted medicinal product . \nIn certain cases, the following components would be assessed by competent authorities in accordance \nwith the requirements of :  \n- a container closure system e.g.  eye drops nozzle without measuring function , syringe for \nreconstitution (without purpose for administration of the medicinal product)  or syringe  without \nmeasuring function  specifically intended to transfer into an IV bag  or \n-  excipient s used in the manufacture of the finished medicinal product e.g. in some implants and \nsome transdermal patches  (using passive diffusion),  \nNote: the above examples are provided as a guide, however some devices could be classified differently \ndue to additional features and functionality.

At what stage of the MAA do I need to submit the notified body opinion?  Rev. May 2024  \nEMA/NCAs strongly recommend submitting the declaration of conformity / EU certificate / notified body \nopinion at the time of submission of  the dossier of the initial marketing authorisation application for the \nmedicinal product to facilitate a smooth running of the procedure. In case the applicant cannot provide \nthe required documentation at the time of MAA submission, the relevant documents  must be provided \nbefore an opinion on the medicinal product application can be issued. Applicants should discuss their \nplans to provide the required documentation during the EMA/NCA pre -submission meeting. The \nabsence of the required documentation may res ult in additional clock stops during the procedure.  \n \n2.4.  Can I provide a notified body opinion concluding on partial compliance with the GSPR ?  \nWhat is the scope of the  notified body opinion ? New May 2024  \nA notified body opinion concluding on partial compliance cannot be accepted as the CHMP and the \nNCAs do not have the remit of assessing compliance of the device part with the General Safety and \nPerformance requirements ( GSPR ). This can hence lead to an evaluation issue  and an updated notified \nbody opinion confirming full compliance with the relevant GSPRs will need to be provided  prior to the \nissuance of  an opinion on the medicinal product .  \nQuestions & Answers for applicants, marketing authorisation holders of medicinal \nproducts and notified bodies with respect to the implementation of the Regulations on \nmedical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices (Regulations (EU) 2017/745 \nand (E    \nEMA/37991/2019 Rev.4 Page 10/23 \n Furthermore, the scope of the n otified body opinion should correspond to the intended purpose  of the \ndevice for the particular marketing authorisation application . \n \n2.5.  How does Article 117 of the MDR impact iDDCs  authorised under MDD ?  Rev. May 2024  \nAnnex I to Directive 2001/83/EC, point 12 of section 3.2, as amended by Article 117 of MDR, is not \nintended to apply retrospectiv ely to iDDCs  already authorised or to those MAAs that have been already \nsubmitted prior to 26 May 2021.  \nHowever, if after the granting of the marketing authorisation there is a  major change to  a device such \nas in its design , performance, safety  or intended purpose of the device (part) that may have a significant \nimpact on the delivery or the quality, safety, or efficacy of the medicinal product , or a new device  is \nintroduced , any required declaration of conformity / EU certificate / notified body opinion should be \nsubmitted as part of the appropriate regulatory procedure to EMA/NCA (see also Q2. 6). \nAs for any other changes, the MAH should determine whether there is a potential impact on  the delivery,  \nquality, safety and/or efficacy of the iDDC. If the MAH determines that the change impacts the registered \ninformation, a variation application according to the variation guideline will be required. If the change \ndoes not impact the registered information but the MAH concludes that there is an im pact on the quality, \nsafety and/or efficacy of the iDDC, a variation application must also be submitted.   \nIn case of change  to the design , performance  or intended purpose of the device (part) or other changes \nto the medicinal product that may affect the medical device , the MAH should  assess and provide a \njustification whether the change has no significant impact on the safety or performance of the device to \njustify the absence of a notified body opinion,  EU certificate or declaration of conformity in accordance \nwith the MDR, as appropriate. Otherwise, an updated or new proof of compliance with the MDR should \nbe provided . \nIn cases where the need for a variation and/or the category of the change is unclear, it is recommended \nthat the national competent authority  for medicinal products  that issued the marketing authorisation is \nconsulted.  \nIn line with the advice provided in the EMA Q&A for Post-authorisation procedural advice for users of the \ncentralised procedure , given the relatively short timelines for variations procedures, the (new/updated) \nEU declaration of conformity / EU certificate issued by a designated notified body / notified body opinion \nfor medical devices should be provided at the time of submission of the application to avoid any delays \nof the procedure.  \n \n2.6.  Will I need to provide a (new or updated) EU declaration of conformity/certificate of \nconformity issued by a notified body/notified body opinion if there are changes to the device \n(or device part) after the initial marketing authorisation of the integral DDC? Rev. May 2024  \nArticle 117 requirement applies post -authorisation to all marketing authorisations, irrespective whether \nalready compliant with Annex I to Directive 2001/83/EC, point 12 of section 3.2, as amended by Article \n117 MDR at the time of the initial MAA, in case of  major  changes to a device  that may affect  significantly  \nthe safety or performance of the device part or the intended use of the device.

Are the requirements for UDI (unique device identifier) applicable to a medicinal \nproduct that incorporates, as an integral part, a medical device? Rev. May 2024  \nA iDDC falling under the medicinal products legislation  does not have to meet MDR obligations related \nto UDI. A device part related UDI should therefore not be applied to the package of such a iDDC. \nAdditional information is provided in the  MDCG 2019 -2 guidance on application of UDI rules to device -\npart of products referred to in Article 1(8), 1(9) and 1(10) of Regulation 2017/745 . \nIn cases where the device part of a iDDC is CE marked, the product labelling for the iDDC should follow \nthe labelling requirements for medicinal products as outlined in the QRD (working group on Quality \nReview of Documents) templates. Where an UDI is already directly marked on the device part, it does \nnot need to be removed. The UDI should not appear on the labelling or outer package of the medicinal \nproduct.  \n \n3.

What requirements for medical device labelling are applicable to medical devices “co -\npackaged” with medicinal products?  Rev. May 2024  \nCo-packaged products need to be distinguished from integral drug-device combinations that form a \nsingle integral product governed either by Directive 2001/83/EC  or Regulation (EC) No 726/2004  or by \nRegulation (EU) No 2017/745 (see also Q2.1 ).  \nIn the case of co -packaged products, the medical device must be in conformity with the MDR9. This \nincludes requirements regarding the information to be supplied with the device, which are part of the \ngeneral safety and performance requirements laid down in Annex I of the MDR.  \nIn accordance with Annex I, Chapter III, 23.1 (b) of Regulation (EU) 2017 /745, the information required \non the label of the medical device (e.g. CE marking, identification of the device, identification of the \nmanufacturer  (and, if applicable of the authorised representative ), lot/serial number, UDI carrier etc.) \nshould be provided on the device itself  or on its own packaging . \nThe product information annexes (SmPC, labelling and package leaflet) of the medicinal product which \nis co-packaged with a medical device, should follow the requirements of Directive 2001/83/EC (see QRD \n(Quality Review of Documents) templates ) and should not include any administrative information such \nas device manufacturer/ authorised representative, CE mark (incl. NB number), device symbols, UDI  or \nreferences to device vigilance  reporting that is provided on or with the medical device.  \nIn accordance with Annex I, Chapter III, Section 23.1 (d) of Regulation (EU) 2017 /745, instructions for \nuse (IFU) for class I and class IIa are not required if such devices can be used safely without any such \ninstructions and unle ss IFU are required by another provision in Section 23. If IFU are required, they \nshould be provided together with the device.  \nRelevant information for the use of the co -packaged device, especially if  necessary for the intended use \nof the medicinal product with the device should be included in the appropriate  sections of the medicinal \nproduct package leaflet and SmPC, as applicable (for details please refer to the SmPC guideline & the \nQRD (Quality Review of Documents) template ).  \nThe MAH may itself be the manufacturer of the co -packaged medical device or assume the responsibility \nof the device  manufacturer in accordance with Article 16(1)(a) of the MDR. In this case, the MAH is \nresponsible for compliance with the MDR during the lifecycle of the device  and only the contact details \nof the MAH need to be provided . \nWhere the MAH is not the manufacturer of  the co -packaged medical device, the medical device \nmanufacturer remains responsible for compliance with the MDR during the lifecycle of the device  and \nneeds to be identified on the device label and/or IFU .  \n \n9  In accordance with Article 120(3) to (3e)  of the MDR, certain devices that are covered by a valid declaration of \nconformity or certificate issued in accordance with Directive 90/385/EEC or Directive 93/42/EEC may be placed on the \nmarket during a transitional period ending on 31 December 2027 or 31 December 2028, depending on the device’s risk .   \nQuestions & Answers for applicants, marketing authorisation holders of medicinal \nproducts and notified bodies with respect to the implementation of the Regulations on \nmedical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices (Regulations (EU) 2017/745 \nand (E    \nEMA/37991/2019 Rev.4 Page 19/23 \n  \n3.2.1 If co-packaged medical devices class I and class  IIa, are supplie d without an individual \npackaging and it is  not technically  feasible  to implement the labelling requirements on the \ndevice itself , what  alternative solutions could be considered to display  the labelling \nrequirements ? New May 2024  \nIn accordance with Annex I, Chapter III, 23.1 (b) of Regulation (EU) 2017 /745, the information required \non the label of the medical device (e.g. identification of the manufacturer , lot/serial number, etc.) should \nbe provided on the device itself  or on its own packaging . However, it is understood that co-packaged \nmedical devices , in particular class I and class IIa (such as dosing devices like measuring spoons, \nmeasuring cups, or measuring syringes …), can be provided in bulk by the device manufacturer without \nan individual packaging  and will  not contain their own packaging  or IFU , pursuant to Annex I, section \n23.1(d). These devices are by nature small and direct marking of any information on the device itself \ncan be  challenging or technically not feasible . \nConsidering that the product information annexes  (which includes the SmPC, labelling and package \nleaflet)  of the medicinal product must not include the required labelling information of the medical device  \n(see Q&A 3.2) , the aim of the below proposed solutions  is to provide for an acceptable way to include \nthe latter information.  \nA. Provide a separate, additional, leaflet within the packaging of the medicinal product, to provide  \nmedical device administrative information  as per the MDR . This option will result in two separate \nleaflets included in the secondary packaging, i.e. the package leaflet (PL) of the medicinal product, \nas well as the leaflet containing the medical device administrative information. It is recommended to \ninclude a cross-reference  to the other leaflet to avoid that one of the two leaflets is overlooked.  \nThe above option is not preferred where  several devices  are co-packaged together with the medicinal \nproduct . Having several leaflets for different devices in the same package could be confusing for the \nend-user.  \nB. Attach t he leaflet containing the medical device administrative information to the package leaflet of \nthe medicinal product and place it within the secondary package of the medicinal product  as one \nsingle folded component.  To implement this option manufacturers shall consider the following:  \n• the leaflet containing the medical device administrative information should be clearly \ndifferentiated from the package leaflet of the medicinal product. This can be achi eved by adding \nthe leaflet containing the medical device administrative information  as a tear -off section at the \nend of the printed package leaflet.  \n• the product information annexes (SmPC, labelling and package leaflet) of the medicinal product, \nwhich is co -packaged with a medical device, should follow the requirements of Directive \n2001/83/EC and should not include any administrative information of the device as laid down by \nMDR.  \n• the purpose of the section containing administrative information of the device should  be clearly \nindicated by using a relevant subheading , e.g. entitled ”<Device name > specific  information” . \n \nC. Affix a fold out vignette /sticker  containing device -specific information directly onto the device itself , \nor on the packaging of each device, when available.   \nThe following points should be considered when including a fold out vignette/sticker:  ""]"

Combinations of medicinal products and medical devices  \n1.1.  What regulatory framework does a product incorporating both medicinal product and \nmedical device fall under? Rev. May 2024  \nProducts which combine a medicinal product (or substance) and a medical device are regulated either \nby Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices or Directive 2001/83/EC  relating to medicinal products \nfor human use , depending on their principal mode of action. Certain combinations of medicinal products \nand medical devices are governed by or require consultation of EMA or a national competent authority  \nfor medicinal products (NCA) , as laid down in Articles 1(8) and 1(9) of the MDR.  \nThe regulatory framework for devices incorporating medicinal substances as an integral part is laid down \nin Article 1(8) of MDR:  \n• Where the action of the medicinal substance is ancillary to the action of the medical device, the \nproduct is regulated as a medical device and must be CE marked. For these combination s, a \nscientific opinion on the quality and safety of the ancillary substance including the benefit or risk \nof its incorporation  in the device  must be provided from one of the national competent authorities  \nfor medicinal products  or from the EMA (referred to collectively as medicines authority) before a \nnotified body can issue a  EU certificate. For more information  on the consultation procedure by \nEMA and for a list of products previously reviewed by EMA, please see EMA webpage on Ancillary \nmedicinal substances in medical devices . \n• Where the action of the medicinal substance is principal  and not ancillary to the action of the \nmedical device, the  integral  drug device combination  (iDDC) is governed under the medicinal \nproducts framework  and are referred to as iDDCs in the Q&A hereafter7. In that case, the relevant \ngeneral safety and performance requirements of the Annex I of the MDR apply to the device part  \nof the iDDC.   \nThe regulatory framework for medical devices intended to administer medicinal products is laid down in \nArticle 1(9) MDR:  \n• If the medicinal product and administration device are marketed as a single integral product  \nintended exclusively for use in the given combination  and is not reusable , the iDDC is \ngoverned under the medicinal products framework. In that case, the relevant general safety and \nperformance requirements of Annex I of the MDR apply to the device part.   \n• In all other cases (e.g. where the medical device is co -packaged with the medicinal product or \nwhen the product information of the medicinal product refers to a specific device to be used and \nthe device is obtained separately ), the administration device is governed by the medical device \nframework. These administration devices must meet the requirements of the MDR and will need \nto be CE marked.  \nFor the purpose of this document, integral products falling within MDR Article 1(8) second subparagraph \nand 1(9) second subparagraph, and for which the principal mode of action is  pharmacologic al, metabolic \nor immunologic al, are regulated under the medicinal products framework.  \n \n7 so-called ‘integral medicinal products’ in the EMA Guideline on quality documentation for medicinal products when used \nwith a medical device  (EMA/CHMP/QWP/BWP/259165/2019)   \nQuestions & Answers for applicants, marketing authorisation holders of medicinal \nproducts and notified bodies with respect to the implementation of the Regulations on \nmedical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices (Regulations (EU) 2017/745 \nand (E    \nEMA/37991/2019 Rev.4 Page 6/23 \n There are cases where a medicinal product and a medical device are placed on the market in the same \nsecondary packaging but do not form an integral product, for example, a vial containing a medicinal \nproduct solution with an (empty) CE marked sterile syrin ge. These are refe rred as a medicine with a co -\npackaged device. This product is not considered a n iDCC as the medical device falls under the first \nsubparagraph of Article 1(9) of the MDR. Furthermore, when a medical device is referenced in the product \ninformation of a medicinal product, for a use in combination  with the  medicinal product , but the two \nproducts are not placed on the EU market within the same secondary packaging,  requirements for these \nproducts are covered in section 3 of this Q&A.  \nOf note, IVD kits may not include medicinal products. If an IVD or an IVD kit is intended to be  used with \na medicinal product and the products are co -packaged, th e combination with the medicinal product may \nnot be qualified as an IVD kit. Each product must comply with its corresponding legislation.  \n1.2.  How do I choose a notified body for my integral drug -device combination? Rev. May \n2024  \nA notified body within the European Union (EU) is a third-party conformity assessment body designated , \nby an EU Member State  authority , to carry out conformity assessment activities regarding medical \ndevices  and/or in-vitro diagnostics  (IVDs)  in accordance with the MDR and/or IVDR before being placed \non the Union market. Companies are free to choose any notified body; the only criterion is that the \nnotified body must be designated to carry out the conformity assessment procedure for the particular \nmedical d evice for which a certification or notified body opinion is sought ; this is defined by the notified \nbody’s designation codes . Applicants can check the NANDO  (New Approach Notified and Designated \nOrganisations) website, by clicking on ‘Legislation’ and select the relevant Directive/Regulation to search \nfor a designated notified body according to the codes/scope needed.  \n1.3 How to obtain advice on the qualification/classification of my drug -device combination , \nespecially for borderline products ? New May 2024 \nBorderline products are those where it is not clear  which regulatory framework applies , i.e., wheth er \nthey fall under the medical device framework  or the pharmaceutical framework .  \nThe demarcation between the MDR on one hand and the pharmaceutical legislation  on the other hand \nis crucial for applying the appropriate set of requirements.  \nThe qualification/classification of a borderline product (e.g. whether it should be regulated as a \nmedicinal product or as a medical device) lies with the national competent authorities for medicinal \nproducts and/or medical devices.  \nSeveral provisions to establish the demarcation between the two legal frameworks have been laid \ndown in the MDR and the Directive 2001/83/EC  and explanations and examples clarifying these \nprovisions can be found in MDCG 2022 – 5 Guidance on borderline between medical devices and \nmedicinal products under Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices . In addition, the MDCG Manual \non borderline and classification for medical devices under Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical \ndevices and Regulation (EU) 2017/746 on in vitro  diagnostic medical devices  records the views of the \nMember State members of the  MDCG  Borderline and Classification Working Group regarding the \nregulatory status of a product (see Section 1.1.2 regarding the borderline between medical devices and \nmedicinal products).  \nQualification and risk classification of medical devices should be agreed with the notified  body, if \napplicable .

The EU declaration of \nconformity should be updated accordingly, if necessary.  \n• For devices covered under an MDR EU certificate  issued by a notified body:  if the \nassessment of changes leads to the issuance of a new/supplemented EU certificate according to \nthe requirements established in the relevant annexes (Annexes IX, X, XI ) of the MDR , the EU \ncertificate must be provided as part of a n appropriate  post-authorisation  regulatory  procedure.    \n• For devices holding a notified body opinion : if the assessment of changes lead to the \nissuance of a new notified body opinion, the new notified body opinion must be provided as part \nof an appropriate  post-authorisation regulatory procedure.  \nContractual arrangements between the notified body and the device manufacturer address the \nnotification obligation and the oversight of changes to the device in the context of the life cycle \nmanagement of a  EU certificate .  \nFor a notified body opinion in the absence of a contractual arrangement between the notified body and \nthe MAH, it is the responsibility of the MAH to determine when a new or updated NB opinion is needed \nin support of a change to the device or its intended use . The MAH is responsible for liaising  with the EMA \nor the NCA for the iDDC. \nAs for any other changes, the MAH should determine whether there is a potential impact on , the delivery,  \nquality , safety and/or efficacy of the iDDC. If the MAH determines that the change impacts the registered \ninformation, the MAH will have to submit a variation application according to the variation guideline.

Depending on the device change(s) and \nconsidering safe and accurate administration and performance, the impact on the Quality Target \nProduct Profile (QTPP), Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) and control strategy for the iDDC should be \nconsidered.  \nIn case of doubt regarding the need to provide a new or revised notified body  opinion  (or DoC or EU \nCertificate)  to support a variation or line extension  and where the need for  a variation and/or the \ncategory of the change is unclear , applicants are strongly recommended to liaise with the national \ncompetent authorities  for medicinal products well in advance during the pre -submission phase.  \nIn line with the advice provided in the EMA Q&A for Post-authorisation procedural advice for use rs of the \ncentralised procedure , given the relatively short timelines for variations procedures, the (new/updated) \nEU declaration of conformity  /EU certificate issued by a designated notified body  / notified body opinion \nfor medical devices should be provided at the time of submission of the application to avoid any delays \nof the procedure.  If not available at submission, it will be legally required before CHMP Opinion (line \nextension and Type II variations) or Notification (Type IB variations).

Combinations of medicinal products and medical devices  \n1.1.  What regulatory framework does a product incorporating both medicinal product and \nmedical device fall under? Rev. May 2024  \nProducts which combine a medicinal product (or substance) and a medical device are regulated either \nby Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices or Directive 2001/83/EC  relating to medicinal products \nfor human use , depending on their principal mode of action. Certain combinations of medicinal products \nand medical devices are governed by or require consultation of EMA or a national competent authority  \nfor medicinal products (NCA) , as laid down in Articles 1(8) and 1(9) of the MDR.  \nThe regulatory framework for devices incorporating medicinal substances as an integral part is laid down \nin Article 1(8) of MDR:  \n• Where the action of the medicinal substance is ancillary to the action of the medical device, the \nproduct is regulated as a medical device and must be CE marked. For these combination s, a \nscientific opinion on the quality and safety of the ancillary substance including the benefit or risk \nof its incorporation  in the device  must be provided from one of the national competent authorities  \nfor medicinal products  or from the EMA (referred to collectively as medicines authority) before a \nnotified body can issue a  EU certificate. For more information  on the consultation procedure by \nEMA and for a list of products previously reviewed by EMA, please see EMA webpage on Ancillary \nmedicinal substances in medical devices . \n• Where the action of the medicinal substance is principal  and not ancillary to the action of the \nmedical device, the  integral  drug device combination  (iDDC) is governed under the medicinal \nproducts framework  and are referred to as iDDCs in the Q&A hereafter7. In that case, the relevant \ngeneral safety and performance requirements of the Annex I of the MDR apply to the device part  \nof the iDDC.   \nThe regulatory framework for medical devices intended to administer medicinal products is laid down in \nArticle 1(9) MDR:  \n• If the medicinal product and administration device are marketed as a single integral product  \nintended exclusively for use in the given combination  and is not reusable , the iDDC is \ngoverned under the medicinal products framework. In that case, the relevant general safety and \nperformance requirements of Annex I of the MDR apply to the device part.   \n• In all other cases (e.g. where the medical device is co -packaged with the medicinal product or \nwhen the product information of the medicinal product refers to a specific device to be used and \nthe device is obtained separately ), the administration device is governed by the medical device \nframework. These administration devices must meet the requirements of the MDR and will need \nto be CE marked.  \nFor the purpose of this document, integral products falling within MDR Article 1(8) second subparagraph \nand 1(9) second subparagraph, and for which the principal mode of action is  pharmacologic al, metabolic \nor immunologic al, are regulated under the medicinal products framework.  \n \n7 so-called ‘integral medicinal products’ in the EMA Guideline on quality documentation for medicinal products when used \nwith a medical device  (EMA/CHMP/QWP/BWP/259165/2019)   \nQuestions & Answers for applicants, marketing authorisation holders of medicinal \nproducts and notified bodies with respect to the implementation of the Regulations on \nmedical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices (Regulations (EU) 2017/745 \nand (E    \nEMA/37991/2019 Rev.4 Page 6/23 \n There are cases where a medicinal product and a medical device are placed on the market in the same \nsecondary packaging but do not form an integral product, for example, a vial containing a medicinal \nproduct solution with an (empty) CE marked sterile syrin ge. These are refe rred as a medicine with a co -\npackaged device. This product is not considered a n iDCC as the medical device falls under the first \nsubparagraph of Article 1(9) of the MDR. Furthermore, when a medical device is referenced in the product \ninformation of a medicinal product, for a use in combination  with the  medicinal product , but the two \nproducts are not placed on the EU market within the same secondary packaging,  requirements for these \nproducts are covered in section 3 of this Q&A.  \nOf note, IVD kits may not include medicinal products. If an IVD or an IVD kit is intended to be  used with \na medicinal product and the products are co -packaged, th e combination with the medicinal product may \nnot be qualified as an IVD kit. Each product must comply with its corresponding legislation.  \n1.2.  How do I choose a notified body for my integral drug -device combination? Rev. May \n2024  \nA notified body within the European Union (EU) is a third-party conformity assessment body designated , \nby an EU Member State  authority , to carry out conformity assessment activities regarding medical \ndevices  and/or in-vitro diagnostics  (IVDs)  in accordance with the MDR and/or IVDR before being placed \non the Union market. Companies are free to choose any notified body; the only criterion is that the \nnotified body must be designated to carry out the conformity assessment procedure for the particular \nmedical d evice for which a certification or notified body opinion is sought ; this is defined by the notified \nbody’s designation codes . Applicants can check the NANDO  (New Approach Notified and Designated \nOrganisations) website, by clicking on ‘Legislation’ and select the relevant Directive/Regulation to search \nfor a designated notified body according to the codes/scope needed.  \n1.3 How to obtain advice on the qualification/classification of my drug -device combination , \nespecially for borderline products ? New May 2024 \nBorderline products are those where it is not clear  which regulatory framework applies , i.e., wheth er \nthey fall under the medical device framework  or the pharmaceutical framework .  \nThe demarcation between the MDR on one hand and the pharmaceutical legislation  on the other hand \nis crucial for applying the appropriate set of requirements.  \nThe qualification/classification of a borderline product (e.g. whether it should be regulated as a \nmedicinal product or as a medical device) lies with the national competent authorities for medicinal \nproducts and/or medical devices.  \nSeveral provisions to establish the demarcation between the two legal frameworks have been laid \ndown in the MDR and the Directive 2001/83/EC  and explanations and examples clarifying these \nprovisions can be found in MDCG 2022 – 5 Guidance on borderline between medical devices and \nmedicinal products under Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices .

The EU declaration of \nconformity should be updated accordingly, if necessary.  \n• For devices covered under an MDR EU certificate  issued by a notified body:  if the \nassessment of changes leads to the issuance of a new/supplemented EU certificate according to \nthe requirements established in the relevant annexes (Annexes IX, X, XI ) of the MDR , the EU \ncertificate must be provided as part of a n appropriate  post-authorisation  regulatory  procedure.    \n• For devices holding a notified body opinion : if the assessment of changes lead to the \nissuance of a new notified body opinion, the new notified body opinion must be provided as part \nof an appropriate  post-authorisation regulatory procedure.  \nContractual arrangements between the notified body and the device manufacturer address the \nnotification obligation and the oversight of changes to the device in the context of the life cycle \nmanagement of a  EU certificate .  \nFor a notified body opinion in the absence of a contractual arrangement between the notified body and \nthe MAH, it is the responsibility of the MAH to determine when a new or updated NB opinion is needed \nin support of a change to the device or its intended use . The MAH is responsible for liaising  with the EMA \nor the NCA for the iDDC. \nAs for any other changes, the MAH should determine whether there is a potential impact on , the delivery,  \nquality , safety and/or efficacy of the iDDC. If the MAH determines that the change impacts the registered \ninformation, the MAH will have to submit a variation application according to the variation guideline. If \nthe change does not impact the registered information but the MAH concludes that there is an impact \non the delivery, quality, safety and/or efficacy of the iDDC, the MAH must also submit  a variat ion \napplication .  \nIn order to support identification of situations where a new or revised notified body  opinion  for the \ndevice part of an iDDC  is anticipated , the following guidance is provide d, however this is without \nprejudice of the specificities of  the concerned product case  and the fact that assessment of compliance \nwith the general safety and performance requirements (GSPRs) of the device remain s the remit of the \nnotified body.    \nQuestions & Answers for applicants, marketing authorisation holders of medicinal \nproducts and notified bodies with respect to the implementation of the Regulations on \nmedical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices (Regulations (EU) 2017/745 \nand (E    \nEMA/37991/2019 Rev.4 Page 12/23 \n In case of a  EU certificate  or device manufacturer’s declaration of conformity (DoC), the MAH should \nfollow the MDR requirements for the maintenance of the EU certificate or DoC.   \nAs a guiding approach, a  new or revised notified body opinion  for the device part of an iDDC  is: \n1) required when a new device is introduced with a line extension or variation;  \n2) expected when major  changes are introduced to an existing device, such as : \n- change to its design  ; \n- Addition or replacement of an integral device (part)  \n- change to its performance characteristics;  \n- change to its intended purpose  such as  a different patient population and/or new user (e.g. \nhome versus hospital setting) and/or new usability study, and/or significantly different \ninstructions for  use. \nwhich may  have a significant impact on the delivery or the quality, safety, or efficacy of the medicinal \nproduct . \n3) expected in case of changes to the medicinal product which may impact the performance or safety \nof a device , for example the introduction of a new finished product formulation resulting in different \nviscosity significantly affecting device performance.  \nIn case a change or combination of changes to the  device part of an iDDC  and/or its intended use is \n(are) not considered to require a new or revised notified body  opinion , applicants are expected to \nprovide a justification and risk assessment in Module 3.2.R. Depending on the device change(s) and \nconsidering safe and accurate administration and performance, the impact on the Quality Target \nProduct Profile (QTPP), Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) and control strategy for the iDDC should be \nconsidered.  \nIn case of doubt regarding the need to provide a new or revised notified body  opinion  (or DoC or EU \nCertificate)  to support a variation or line extension  and where the need for  a variation and/or the \ncategory of the change is unclear , applicants are strongly recommended to liaise with the national \ncompetent authorities  for medicinal products well in advance during the pre -submission phase.  \nIn line with the advice provided in the EMA Q&A for Post-authorisation procedural advice for use rs of the \ncentralised procedure , given the relatively short timelines for variations procedures, the (new/updated) \nEU declaration of conformity  /EU certificate issued by a designated notified body  / notified body opinion \nfor medical devices should be provided at the time of submission of the application to avoid any delays \nof the procedure.  If not available at submission, it will be legally required before CHMP Opinion (line \nextension and Type II variations) or Notification (Type IB variations). The notified body opinion  should \nconfirm full compliance with the relevant GSPRs and correspond to the intended use of the device  part \nof an iDDC  as claimed in the line extension or variation.  \nPlease read this question  in conjunction with question s 2.7 and 2.8 .  \n \n2.7.

What requirements for medical device labelling are applicable to medical devices “co -\npackaged” with medicinal products?  Rev. May 2024  \nCo-packaged products need to be distinguished from integral drug-device combinations that form a \nsingle integral product governed either by Directive 2001/83/EC  or Regulation (EC) No 726/2004  or by \nRegulation (EU) No 2017/745 (see also Q2.1 ).  \nIn the case of co -packaged products, the medical device must be in conformity with the MDR9. This \nincludes requirements regarding the information to be supplied with the device, which are part of the \ngeneral safety and performance requirements laid down in Annex I of the MDR.  \nIn accordance with Annex I, Chapter III, 23.1 (b) of Regulation (EU) 2017 /745, the information required \non the label of the medical device (e.g. CE marking, identification of the device, identification of the \nmanufacturer  (and, if applicable of the authorised representative ), lot/serial number, UDI carrier etc.) \nshould be provided on the device itself  or on its own packaging . \nThe product information annexes (SmPC, labelling and package leaflet) of the medicinal product which \nis co-packaged with a medical device, should follow the requirements of Directive 2001/83/EC (see QRD \n(Quality Review of Documents) templates ) and should not include any administrative information such \nas device manufacturer/ authorised representative, CE mark (incl. NB number), device symbols, UDI  or \nreferences to device vigilance  reporting that is provided on or with the medical device.  \nIn accordance with Annex I, Chapter III, Section 23.1 (d) of Regulation (EU) 2017 /745, instructions for \nuse (IFU) for class I and class IIa are not required if such devices can be used safely without any such \ninstructions and unle ss IFU are required by another provision in Section 23. If IFU are required, they \nshould be provided together with the device.  \nRelevant information for the use of the co -packaged device, especially if  necessary for the intended use \nof the medicinal product with the device should be included in the appropriate  sections of the medicinal \nproduct package leaflet and SmPC, as applicable (for details please refer to the SmPC guideline & the \nQRD (Quality Review of Documents) template ).  \nThe MAH may itself be the manufacturer of the co -packaged medical device or assume the responsibility \nof the device  manufacturer in accordance with Article 16(1)(a) of the MDR. In this case, the MAH is \nresponsible for compliance with the MDR during the lifecycle of the device  and only the contact details \nof the MAH need to be provided . \nWhere the MAH is not the manufacturer of  the co -packaged medical device, the medical device \nmanufacturer remains responsible for compliance with the MDR during the lifecycle of the device  and \nneeds to be identified on the device label and/or IFU .  \n \n9  In accordance with Article 120(3) to (3e)  of the MDR, certain devices that are covered by a valid declaration of \nconformity or certificate issued in accordance with Directive 90/385/EEC or Directive 93/42/EEC may be placed on the \nmarket during a transitional period ending on 31 December 2027 or 31 December 2028, depending on the device’s risk .   \nQuestions & Answers for applicants, marketing authorisation holders of medicinal \nproducts and notified bodies with respect to the implementation of the Regulations on \nmedical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices (Regulations (EU) 2017/745 \nand (E    \nEMA/37991/2019 Rev.4 Page 19/23 \n  \n3.2.1 If co-packaged medical devices class I and class  IIa, are supplie d without an individual \npackaging and it is  not technically  feasible  to implement the labelling requirements on the \ndevice itself , what  alternative solutions could be considered to display  the labelling \nrequirements ? New May 2024  \nIn accordance with Annex I, Chapter III, 23.1 (b) of Regulation (EU) 2017 /745, the information required \non the label of the medical device (e.g. identification of the manufacturer , lot/serial number, etc.) should \nbe provided on the device itself  or on its own packaging . However, it is understood that co-packaged \nmedical devices , in particular class I and class IIa (such as dosing devices like measuring spoons, \nmeasuring cups, or measuring syringes …), can be provided in bulk by the device manufacturer without \nan individual packaging  and will  not contain their own packaging  or IFU , pursuant to Annex I, section \n23.1(d). These devices are by nature small and direct marking of any information on the device itself \ncan be  challenging or technically not feasible . \nConsidering that the product information annexes  (which includes the SmPC, labelling and package \nleaflet)  of the medicinal product must not include the required labelling information of the medical device  \n(see Q&A 3.2) , the aim of the below proposed solutions  is to provide for an acceptable way to include \nthe latter information.  \nA. Provide a separate, additional, leaflet within the packaging of the medicinal product, to provide  \nmedical device administrative information  as per the MDR . This option will result in two separate \nleaflets included in the secondary packaging, i.e. the package leaflet (PL) of the medicinal product, \nas well as the leaflet containing the medical device administrative information. It is recommended to \ninclude a cross-reference  to the other leaflet to avoid that one of the two leaflets is overlooked.  \nThe above option is not preferred where  several devices  are co-packaged together with the medicinal \nproduct . Having several leaflets for different devices in the same package could be confusing for the \nend-user.  \nB. Attach t he leaflet containing the medical device administrative information to the package leaflet of \nthe medicinal product and place it within the secondary package of the medicinal product  as one \nsingle folded component.  To implement this option manufacturers shall consider the following:  \n• the leaflet containing the medical device administrative information should be clearly \ndifferentiated from the package leaflet of the medicinal product. This can be achi eved by adding \nthe leaflet containing the medical device administrative information  as a tear -off section at the \nend of the printed package leaflet.  \n• the product information annexes (SmPC, labelling and package leaflet) of the medicinal product, \nwhich is co -packaged with a medical device, should follow the requirements of Directive \n2001/83/EC and should not include any administrative information of the device as laid down by \nMDR.  \n• the purpose of the section containing administrative information of the device should  be clearly \nindicated by using a relevant subheading , e.g. entitled ”<Device name > specific  information” . \n \nC. Affix a fold out vignette /sticker  containing device -specific information directly onto the device itself , \nor on the packaging of each device, when available.   \nThe following points should be considered when including a fold out vignette/sticker:  ""]"

Integral Drug -Device Combinations  \n2.1.  When is my medical device considered to form an integral product with a medicinal \nproduct?  Rev. May 2024  \nThere are two types of iDDCs8 according to MDR Articles 1(8) and 1(9) (see also Question 1.1).  \n1. A medical device that incorporates, as an integral part, a substance which, if used separately, would \nbe considered a medicinal product and where the action of that substance is principal, the integral \nproduct will be regulated as a medicinal product (seco nd subparagraph of Article 1(8)). Examples \ninclude an ingestible sensor that is incorporated  into a medicinal product.  \n2. If a medical device used to administer a medicinal product is  placed on the market in such a way \nthat the  two constituents parts (the medical device and medicinal product)  form a single integral \nproduct which is intended exclusively for use in the given combination and which is not reusable, \nthat single integral product shall be governed by Directive 2001/83/EC or Regulation (EC) No \n726/2004, as applicable. The second paragraph  of Article 1(9) of the MDR sets out three cumulative \nconditions that need to be satisfied at the moment of placing on the market:  \ni. the device and the medicinal product form a single integral product  when placed on the market , \nii. the single integral product is intended exclusively for use in the given combination , \niii. the single integral product is not reusable.  \nBelow are provided some examples.  \nFor medicinal products meeting either one or both of the above definitions , the integral product shall \nbe governed by Directive 2001/83/EC or Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, as applicable . However, the \nrelevant general safety and performance requirements set out in Annex I to Regulation  (EU) 2017/745 \nshall apply as far as the safety and performance of the device part of the integral product is concerned.  \n \n8 so-called ‘integral medicinal products’ in the EMA Guideline on quality documentation for medicinal products when used \nwith a medical device  (EMA/CHMP/QWP/BWP/259165/2019)   \nQuestions & Answers for applicants, marketing authorisation holders of medicinal \nproducts and notified bodies with respect to the implementation of the Regulations on \nmedical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices (Regulations (EU) 2017/745 \nand (E    \nEMA/37991/2019 Rev.4 Page 8/23 \n Examples of integral products which are not reusable are pre -filled syringes, pre -filled pens, nebuli sers \npre-charged with a specific medicinal product, nasal and oromucosal sprays, patches for transdermal \ndrug delivery , pre-filled inhalers  and co-packaged pre-filled syringe with solvent  (e.g. water for \ninjections)  used for administration of the reconstituted medicinal product . \nIn certain cases, the following components would be assessed by competent authorities in accordance \nwith the requirements of :  \n- a container closure system e.g.  eye drops nozzle without measuring function , syringe for \nreconstitution (without purpose for administration of the medicinal product)  or syringe  without \nmeasuring function  specifically intended to transfer into an IV bag  or \n-  excipient s used in the manufacture of the finished medicinal product e.g. in some implants and \nsome transdermal patches  (using passive diffusion),  \nNote: the above examples are provided as a guide, however some devices could be classified differently \ndue to additional features and functionality.

May 2024  \nEMA/NCAs strongly recommend submitting the declaration of conformity / EU certificate / notified body \nopinion at the time of submission of  the dossier of the initial marketing authorisation application for the \nmedicinal product to facilitate a smooth running of the procedure. In case the applicant cannot provide \nthe required documentation at the time of MAA submission, the relevant documents  must be provided \nbefore an opinion on the medicinal product application can be issued. Applicants should discuss their \nplans to provide the required documentation during the EMA/NCA pre -submission meeting. The \nabsence of the required documentation may res ult in additional clock stops during the procedure.  \n \n2.4.  Can I provide a notified body opinion concluding on partial compliance with the GSPR ?  \nWhat is the scope of the  notified body opinion ? New May 2024  \nA notified body opinion concluding on partial compliance cannot be accepted as the CHMP and the \nNCAs do not have the remit of assessing compliance of the device part with the General Safety and \nPerformance requirements ( GSPR ). This can hence lead to an evaluation issue  and an updated notified \nbody opinion confirming full compliance with the relevant GSPRs will need to be provided  prior to the \nissuance of  an opinion on the medicinal product .  \nQuestions & Answers for applicants, marketing authorisation holders of medicinal \nproducts and notified bodies with respect to the implementation of the Regulations on \nmedical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices (Regulations (EU) 2017/745 \nand (E    \nEMA/37991/2019 Rev.4 Page 10/23 \n Furthermore, the scope of the n otified body opinion should correspond to the intended purpose  of the \ndevice for the particular marketing authorisation application . \n \n2.5.  How does Article 117 of the MDR impact iDDCs  authorised under MDD ?  Rev. May 2024  \nAnnex I to Directive 2001/83/EC, point 12 of section 3.2, as amended by Article 117 of MDR, is not \nintended to apply retrospectiv ely to iDDCs  already authorised or to those MAAs that have been already \nsubmitted prior to 26 May 2021.  \nHowever, if after the granting of the marketing authorisation there is a  major change to  a device such \nas in its design , performance, safety  or intended purpose of the device (part) that may have a significant \nimpact on the delivery or the quality, safety, or efficacy of the medicinal product , or a new device  is \nintroduced , any required declaration of conformity / EU certificate / notified body opinion should be \nsubmitted as part of the appropriate regulatory procedure to EMA/NCA (see also Q2. 6). \nAs for any other changes, the MAH should determine whether there is a potential impact on  the delivery,  \nquality, safety and/or efficacy of the iDDC. If the MAH determines that the change impacts the registered \ninformation, a variation application according to the variation guideline will be required. If the change \ndoes not impact the registered information but the MAH concludes that there is an im pact on the quality, \nsafety and/or efficacy of the iDDC, a variation application must also be submitted.   \nIn case of change  to the design , performance  or intended purpose of the device (part) or other changes \nto the medicinal product that may affect the medical device , the MAH should  assess and provide a \njustification whether the change has no significant impact on the safety or performance of the device to \njustify the absence of a notified body opinion,  EU certificate or declaration of conformity in accordance \nwith the MDR, as appropriate. Otherwise, an updated or new proof of compliance with the MDR should \nbe provided . \nIn cases where the need for a variation and/or the category of the change is unclear, it is recommended \nthat the national competent authority  for medicinal products  that issued the marketing authorisation is \nconsulted.  \nIn line with the advice provided in the EMA Q&A for Post-authorisation procedural advice for users of the \ncentralised procedure , given the relatively short timelines for variations procedures, the (new/updated) \nEU declaration of conformity / EU certificate issued by a designated notified body / notified body opinion \nfor medical devices should be provided at the time of submission of the application to avoid any delays \nof the procedure.  \n \n2.6.  Will I need to provide a (new or updated) EU declaration of conformity/certificate of \nconformity issued by a notified body/notified body opinion if there are changes to the device \n(or device part) after the initial marketing authorisation of the integral DDC? Rev. May 2024  \nArticle 117 requirement applies post -authorisation to all marketing authorisations, irrespective whether \nalready compliant with Annex I to Directive 2001/83/EC, point 12 of section 3.2, as amended by Article \n117 MDR at the time of the initial MAA, in case of  major  changes to a device  that may affect  significantly  \nthe safety or performance of the device part or the intended use of the device.

Are the requirements for UDI (unique device identifier) applicable to a medicinal \nproduct that incorporates, as an integral part, a medical device? Rev. May 2024  \nA iDDC falling under the medicinal products legislation  does not have to meet MDR obligations related \nto UDI. A device part related UDI should therefore not be applied to the package of such a iDDC. \nAdditional information is provided in the  MDCG 2019 -2 guidance on application of UDI rules to device -\npart of products referred to in Article 1(8), 1(9) and 1(10) of Regulation 2017/745 . \nIn cases where the device part of a iDDC is CE marked, the product labelling for the iDDC should follow \nthe labelling requirements for medicinal products as outlined in the QRD (working group on Quality \nReview of Documents) templates. Where an UDI is already directly marked on the device part, it does \nnot need to be removed. The UDI should not appear on the labelling or outer package of the medicinal \nproduct.  \n \n3.  Medicinal products that include a medical device in the \nsecondary packaging of the marketed medicinal product ( co-\npackaged ) \n3.1.  How will the MDR affect the co -packaged medical device ? Rev.

If your self -\nCE marked  Class I device is up -classified by the MDR then the transition period provided for in MDR \nArticle 120(3 b) is applicable.  \n3.2.  What requirements for medical device labelling are applicable to medical devices “co -\npackaged” with medicinal products?  Rev. May 2024  \nCo-packaged products need to be distinguished from integral drug-device combinations that form a \nsingle integral product governed either by Directive 2001/83/EC  or Regulation (EC) No 726/2004  or by \nRegulation (EU) No 2017/745 (see also Q2.1 ).  \nIn the case of co -packaged products, the medical device must be in conformity with the MDR9. This \nincludes requirements regarding the information to be supplied with the device, which are part of the \ngeneral safety and performance requirements laid down in Annex I of the MDR.  \nIn accordance with Annex I, Chapter III, 23.1 (b) of Regulation (EU) 2017 /745, the information required \non the label of the medical device (e.g. CE marking, identification of the device, identification of the \nmanufacturer  (and, if applicable of the authorised representative ), lot/serial number, UDI carrier etc.) \nshould be provided on the device itself  or on its own packaging . \nThe product information annexes (SmPC, labelling and package leaflet) of the medicinal product which \nis co-packaged with a medical device, should follow the requirements of Directive 2001/83/EC (see QRD \n(Quality Review of Documents) templates ) and should not include any administrative information such \nas device manufacturer/ authorised representative, CE mark (incl. NB number), device symbols, UDI  or \nreferences to device vigilance  reporting that is provided on or with the medical device.  \nIn accordance with Annex I, Chapter III, Section 23.1 (d) of Regulation (EU) 2017 /745, instructions for \nuse (IFU) for class I and class IIa are not required if such devices can be used safely without any such \ninstructions and unle ss IFU are required by another provision in Section 23. If IFU are required, they \nshould be provided together with the device.  \nRelevant information for the use of the co -packaged device, especially if  necessary for the intended use \nof the medicinal product with the device should be included in the appropriate  sections of the medicinal \nproduct package leaflet and SmPC, as applicable (for details please refer to the SmPC guideline & the \nQRD (Quality Review of Documents) template ).  \nThe MAH may itself be the manufacturer of the co -packaged medical device or assume the responsibility \nof the device  manufacturer in accordance with Article 16(1)(a) of the MDR. In this case, the MAH is \nresponsible for compliance with the MDR during the lifecycle of the device  and only the contact details \nof the MAH need to be provided . \nWhere the MAH is not the manufacturer of  the co -packaged medical device, the medical device \nmanufacturer remains responsible for compliance with the MDR during the lifecycle of the device  and \nneeds to be identified on the device label and/or IFU .  \n \n9  In accordance with Article 120(3) to (3e)  of the MDR, certain devices that are covered by a valid declaration of \nconformity or certificate issued in accordance with Directive 90/385/EEC or Directive 93/42/EEC may be placed on the \nmarket during a transitional period ending on 31 December 2027 or 31 December 2028, depending on the device’s risk .   \nQuestions & Answers for applicants, marketing authorisation holders of medicinal \nproducts and notified bodies with respect to the implementation of the Regulations on \nmedical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices (Regulations (EU) 2017/745 \nand (E    \nEMA/37991/2019 Rev.4 Page 19/23 \n  \n3.2.1 If co-packaged medical devices class I and class  IIa, are supplie d without an individual \npackaging and it is  not technically  feasible  to implement the labelling requirements on the \ndevice itself , what  alternative solutions could be considered to display  the labelling \nrequirements ? New May 2024  \nIn accordance with Annex I, Chapter III, 23.1 (b) of Regulation (EU) 2017 /745, the information required \non the label of the medical device (e.g. identification of the manufacturer , lot/serial number, etc.) should \nbe provided on the device itself  or on its own packaging . However, it is understood that co-packaged \nmedical devices , in particular class I and class IIa (such as dosing devices like measuring spoons, \nmeasuring cups, or measuring syringes …), can be provided in bulk by the device manufacturer without \nan individual packaging  and will  not contain their own packaging  or IFU , pursuant to Annex I, section \n23.1(d). These devices are by nature small and direct marking of any information on the device itself \ncan be  challenging or technically not feasible . \nConsidering that the product information annexes  (which includes the SmPC, labelling and package \nleaflet)  of the medicinal product must not include the required labelling information of the medical device  \n(see Q&A 3.2) , the aim of the below proposed solutions  is to provide for an acceptable way to include \nthe latter information.  \nA. Provide a separate, additional, leaflet within the packaging of the medicinal product, to provide  \nmedical device administrative information  as per the MDR . This option will result in two separate \nleaflets included in the secondary packaging, i.e. the package leaflet (PL) of the medicinal product, \nas well as the leaflet containing the medical device administrative information. It is recommended to \ninclude a cross-reference  to the other leaflet to avoid that one of the two leaflets is overlooked.  \nThe above option is not preferred where  several devices  are co-packaged together with the medicinal \nproduct . Having several leaflets for different devices in the same package could be confusing for the \nend-user.  \nB. Attach t he leaflet containing the medical device administrative information to the package leaflet of \nthe medicinal product and place it within the secondary package of the medicinal product  as one \nsingle folded component.  To implement this option manufacturers shall consider the following:  \n• the leaflet containing the medical device administrative information should be clearly \ndifferentiated from the package leaflet of the medicinal product. This can be achi eved by adding \nthe leaflet containing the medical device administrative information  as a tear -off section at the \nend of the printed package leaflet.  \n• the product information annexes (SmPC, labelling and package leaflet) of the medicinal product, \nwhich is co -packaged with a medical device, should follow the requirements of Directive \n2001/83/EC and should not include any administrative information of the device as laid down by \nMDR.  \n• the purpose of the section containing administrative information of the device should  be clearly \nindicated by using a relevant subheading , e.g. entitled ”<Device name > specific  information” . \n \nC. Affix a fold out vignette /sticker  containing device -specific information directly onto the device itself , \nor on the packaging of each device, when available.   \nThe following points should be considered when including a fold out vignette/sticker:  ""]"

What requirements for medical device labelling are applicable to medical devices “co -\npackaged” with medicinal products?  Rev. May 2024  \nCo-packaged products need to be distinguished from integral drug-device combinations that form a \nsingle integral product governed either by Directive 2001/83/EC  or Regulation (EC) No 726/2004  or by \nRegulation (EU) No 2017/745 (see also Q2.1 ).  \nIn the case of co -packaged products, the medical device must be in conformity with the MDR9. This \nincludes requirements regarding the information to be supplied with the device, which are part of the \ngeneral safety and performance requirements laid down in Annex I of the MDR.  \nIn accordance with Annex I, Chapter III, 23.1 (b) of Regulation (EU) 2017 /745, the information required \non the label of the medical device (e.g. CE marking, identification of the device, identification of the \nmanufacturer  (and, if applicable of the authorised representative ), lot/serial number, UDI carrier etc.) \nshould be provided on the device itself  or on its own packaging . \nThe product information annexes (SmPC, labelling and package leaflet) of the medicinal product which \nis co-packaged with a medical device, should follow the requirements of Directive 2001/83/EC (see QRD \n(Quality Review of Documents) templates ) and should not include any administrative information such \nas device manufacturer/ authorised representative, CE mark (incl. NB number), device symbols, UDI  or \nreferences to device vigilance  reporting that is provided on or with the medical device.  \nIn accordance with Annex I, Chapter III, Section 23.1 (d) of Regulation (EU) 2017 /745, instructions for \nuse (IFU) for class I and class IIa are not required if such devices can be used safely without any such \ninstructions and unle ss IFU are required by another provision in Section 23. If IFU are required, they \nshould be provided together with the device.  \nRelevant information for the use of the co -packaged device, especially if  necessary for the intended use \nof the medicinal product with the device should be included in the appropriate  sections of the medicinal \nproduct package leaflet and SmPC, as applicable (for details please refer to the SmPC guideline & the \nQRD (Quality Review of Documents) template ).  \nThe MAH may itself be the manufacturer of the co -packaged medical device or assume the responsibility \nof the device  manufacturer in accordance with Article 16(1)(a) of the MDR. In this case, the MAH is \nresponsible for compliance with the MDR during the lifecycle of the device  and only the contact details \nof the MAH need to be provided . \nWhere the MAH is not the manufacturer of  the co -packaged medical device, the medical device \nmanufacturer remains responsible for compliance with the MDR during the lifecycle of the device  and \nneeds to be identified on the device label and/or IFU .  \n \n9  In accordance with Article 120(3) to (3e)  of the MDR, certain devices that are covered by a valid declaration of \nconformity or certificate issued in accordance with Directive 90/385/EEC or Directive 93/42/EEC may be placed on the \nmarket during a transitional period ending on 31 December 2027 or 31 December 2028, depending on the device’s risk .   \nQuestions & Answers for applicants, marketing authorisation holders of medicinal \nproducts and notified bodies with respect to the implementation of the Regulations on \nmedical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices (Regulations (EU) 2017/745 \nand (E    \nEMA/37991/2019 Rev.4 Page 19/23 \n  \n3.2.1 If co-packaged medical devices class I and class  IIa, are supplie d without an individual \npackaging and it is  not technically  feasible  to implement the labelling requirements on the \ndevice itself , what  alternative solutions could be considered to display  the labelling \nrequirements ? New May 2024  \nIn accordance with Annex I, Chapter III, 23.1 (b) of Regulation (EU) 2017 /745, the information required \non the label of the medical device (e.g. identification of the manufacturer , lot/serial number, etc.) should \nbe provided on the device itself  or on its own packaging . However, it is understood that co-packaged \nmedical devices , in particular class I and class IIa (such as dosing devices like measuring spoons, \nmeasuring cups, or measuring syringes …), can be provided in bulk by the device manufacturer without \nan individual packaging  and will  not contain their own packaging  or IFU , pursuant to Annex I, section \n23.1(d). These devices are by nature small and direct marking of any information on the device itself \ncan be  challenging or technically not feasible . \nConsidering that the product information annexes  (which includes the SmPC, labelling and package \nleaflet)  of the medicinal product must not include the required labelling information of the medical device  \n(see Q&A 3.2) , the aim of the below proposed solutions  is to provide for an acceptable way to include \nthe latter information.  \nA. Provide a separate, additional, leaflet within the packaging of the medicinal product, to provide  \nmedical device administrative information  as per the MDR . This option will result in two separate \nleaflets included in the secondary packaging, i.e. the package leaflet (PL) of the medicinal product, \nas well as the leaflet containing the medical device administrative information. It is recommended to \ninclude a cross-reference  to the other leaflet to avoid that one of the two leaflets is overlooked.  \nThe above option is not preferred where  several devices  are co-packaged together with the medicinal \nproduct . Having several leaflets for different devices in the same package could be confusing for the \nend-user.  \nB. Attach t he leaflet containing the medical device administrative information to the package leaflet of \nthe medicinal product and place it within the secondary package of the medicinal product  as one \nsingle folded component.  To implement this option manufacturers shall consider the following:  \n• the leaflet containing the medical device administrative information should be clearly \ndifferentiated from the package leaflet of the medicinal product. This can be achi eved by adding \nthe leaflet containing the medical device administrative information  as a tear -off section at the \nend of the printed package leaflet.  \n• the product information annexes (SmPC, labelling and package leaflet) of the medicinal product, \nwhich is co -packaged with a medical device, should follow the requirements of Directive \n2001/83/EC and should not include any administrative information of the device as laid down by \nMDR.  \n• the purpose of the section containing administrative information of the device should  be clearly \nindicated by using a relevant subheading , e.g. entitled ”<Device name > specific  information” . \n \nC. Affix a fold out vignette /sticker  containing device -specific information directly onto the device itself , \nor on the packaging of each device, when available.   \nThe following points should be considered when including a fold out vignette/sticker:  ""]"

In such case a new or updated notified body \nopinion might not be needed in support to the variation to the MA.   \n• New strength   \nIn case of a new strength to an existing iDDC and if there is no change to the device, the MAH should \nassess and provide a justification whether the new strength  has no significant impact on the safety  and \nperformance of the device. In such case a new or updated NB opinion might not be needed in support \nto the regulatory procedure  to change the MA.    \n• New pharmaceutical form  \nIn case the new pharmaceutical form is combined with the introduction of a device, depending whether \nthe medical device forms an integral part with the medicinal product or is co -packaged, the appropriate \nproof of compliance with the MDR will need to be provided.  \nIn case the new pharmaceutical form  is combined with a device already  authorised for the medicinal \nproduct,  the MAH should assess whether the new pharmaceutical form  may have a  significant impact \non the safety and performance of the device.
